The medical necessity criteria that follow are \nguidelines for the provision of diagnostic imaging. These criteria are \ndesigned to guide both providers and reviewers to the most appropriate \ndiagnostic tests based on a patient\u2019s unique circumstances. In all cases, \nclinical judgment consistent with the standards of good medical practice \nwill be used when applying the guidelines. Determinations are made based \non both the guideline and clinical information provided at the time of the \nrequest. It is expected that medical necessity decisions may change as new \nevidence-based information is provided or based on unique aspects of the \npatient\u2019s condition. The treating clinician has final authority and \nresponsibility for treatment decisions regarding the care of the patient.\n\nGuideline Development Process \nThese medical necessity criteria were developed by Evolent for the purpose \nof making clinical review determinations for requests for therapies and \ndiagnostic procedures.  The developers of the criteria sets included \nrepresentatives from the disciplines of radiology, internal medicine, nursing, \ncardiology, and other specialty groups.  Evolent\u2019s guidelines are reviewed \nyearly and modified when necessary following a literature search of \npertinent and established clinical guidelines and accepted diagnostic \nimaging practices.   \n\nAll inquiries should be directed to: \nEvolent Specialty Services, Inc.\n\nc/o Privacy\n1812 N.

Symptoms may include jaw pain, masticator muscle \nstiffness, limited movement or locking of the jaw, clicking or popping in jaw joint when \nopening or closing the mouth, and a change in how the upper and lower teeth fit together. \nThe cause of the condition is not always clear but may include acute or chronic trauma to the \njaw or temporomandibular joint, e.g., grinding of teeth, clenching of jaw, or impact in an \naccident. Osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis may also contribute to the condition. \n\nTMD Etiologies \nEtiologies of TMJ dysfunction (TMD) include intra-articular (intracapsular) and extra-articular \n(extracapsular pathology). Intra-articular (intracapsular pathology), such as disc \ndisplacement and coexisting osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease, is considered the \nmost common cause of serious TMJ pain and dysfunction and the most likely to be treated \nsurgically. Extra-articular (extracapsular pathology) includes musculoskeletal (bone, \nmasticatory muscles and tendons) and central nervous system/peripheral nervous system.(8) \n\nTMD Imaging \nImaging can assist in the diagnosis of TMD when history and physical examination findings \nare equivocal. The initial study should be plain radiography (transcranial and transmaxillary \nviews) or panoramic radiography when there is recent trauma, dislocation, malocclusion, or \ndental infection.(3) Ultrasound is an inexpensive and easily performed imaging modality that \ncan also be used to evaluate the TMJ.(2) CT is useful to evaluate the bony structures of the \nTMJ when there is suspicion of bony involvement (i.e., fractures, erosions, infection, invasion \nby tumor, as well as congenital anomalies).(2) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the \nhighest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the evaluation of temporomandibular joint \ndysfunction and provides tissue contrast for visualizing the soft tissue and periarticular \nstructures of the TMJ.  \n\nTMD Conservative Care \nConservative care for TMD includes patient education, self-care, behavioral modification, \ncognitive behavioral therapy/biofeedback, medication, physical therapy, and occlusive \ndevices. Medications includes NSAIDS and muscle relaxants (for spasms) and in chronic \ncases benzodiazepines or antidepressants.  \n\nThere is lack of high-quality evidence and uncertainty about the effectiveness of manual \ntherapy and therapeutic physical therapy in treating TMJ dysfunction.(9)  \n\nThe use of occlusive splints is thought to alleviate some of the degenerative forces on the \nTMJ which may be helpful in patients with bruxism or nocturnal teeth clenching. Preferred \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 7 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 007 for Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) MRI \n\ndevices are unclear from the literature and dental consultation is required. (3) In systematic \nreviews, there has been short-term benefit observed from splinting but no clear role in the \noverall long-term treatment of TMD patients.(10,11) \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine \n\nPOLICY SUMMARY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Updated references \n\n\u25cf Added Contraindications and Preferred Studies section \nApril 2023 \u25cf Updated references \n\n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of \nindeterminate findings on prior imaging \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nSpecial Note \nBrain CT/CTA are not approvable simultaneously unless they meet the criteria described \nbelow in the Indications for Brain CT/Brain CTA combination studies section. If there is a \ncombination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the same time or \nsequentially (within the past 3 months) the results of the prior study should be: \n\n\u25cf Inconclusive or show a need for additional or follow up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient. \n\n\u25cf (*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nPurpose \nBrain CT \nComputed tomography (CT) is an imaging technique used to view the structures of the brain \nand is useful in evaluating pathologies in the brain. It provides more detailed information on \nhead trauma, brain tumors, stroke, and other pathologies in the brain than regular \nradiographs. \n\nImportant Note: Brain MRI is preferred to Brain CT in most circumstances where the patient \ncan tolerate MRI and sufficient time is available to schedule the MRI examination. \nAssessment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute trauma, or bone abnormalities of the \ncalvarium (fracture, etc.) may be better imaged with CT. CT is also appropriate in an urgent \nsituation where MRI is not readily available (stroke, increased ICP, CNS infection). \n\n# \u2014 Designates CT is indicated only when MRI is contraindicated or cannot be \nperformed \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 28 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 002 for Brain CT \n\nINDICATIONS \nHeadache \nEvaluation of Headache \n\n\u25cf Chronic headache with a change in character/pattern (e.g., more frequent, increased \nseverity, or duration) (1) # \n\n\u25cf Cluster headaches or other trigeminal-autonomic cephalgias, i.e., paroxysmal \nhemicrania, hemicrania continua, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache \nattacks (SUNCT/SUNA) imaging is indicated once to eliminate secondary causes (1,2) \n# \n\n\u25cf Acute headache, sudden onset: \n\n\u25cb With a personal or family history (brother, sister, parent, or child) of brain \naneurysm or AVM (arteriovenous malformation) OR \n\n\u25cb < 48 hours of \u201cworst headache in my life\u201d or \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache (Sudden \nonset new headache reaching maximum intensity within 2-3 minutes, lasting \nmore than 5 minutes). \n\n\u25cb Prior history of stroke or intracranial bleed \n\n\u25cb Known coagulopathy or on anticoagulation \n\n\u25cf New onset of headache with any of the following (1,3,4): \n\n\u25cb Acute, new, or fluctuating neurologic deficits, such as sensory deficits, limb \nweakness, abnormal reflexes (pathological, asymmetric, hyperreflexia), speech \ndifficulties, visual loss, lack of coordination, or mental status changes or with \nsigns of increased intracranial pressure (papilledema).

Acute headaches are present from hours to days, subacute from days \nto weeks and chronic headaches for more than 3 months. Acute severe headaches are more \nlikely to be pathological (e.g., SAH, cerebral venous thrombosis) than non-acute (e.g., \nmigraine, tension-type). Headaches can also be categorized as new onset or \nchronic/recurrent. Non-acute new onset headaches do not require imaging unless there is a \nred flag as delineated above. Incidental findings lead to additional medical procedures and \nexpense that do not improve patient well-being. Primary headache syndromes, such as \nmigraine and tension headaches, are often episodic with persistent or progressive headache \nnot responding to treatment requiring further investigation (e.g., new daily persistent \nheadache). Imaging is indicated in chronic headaches if there is a change in the headache \nfrequency (number of headaches episodes/month), duration of each episode, severity of the \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 16 of 28 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 002 for Brain CT \n\nheadaches or new characteristics, such as changing aura or associated symptoms. \n(1,2,89,90,91,92,93,94,95) \n\nMigraine with aura (2,3,96) \u2013 The headache phase of a migraine is preceded and/or \naccompanied by transient neurological symptoms referred to as aura in at least a third of \nmigraine attacks. Migraine with typical aura consists of visual and/or sensory and/or \nspeech/language symptoms, but no motor, brainstem or retinal symptoms and is \ncharacterized by gradual development, duration of each symptom no longer than one hour, a \nmix of positive and negative features and complete reversibility. Atypical or complex aura \nincludes motor, brainstem, monocular visual disturbances, or ocular cranial nerve \ninvolvement (hemiplegic migraine, basilar migraine/brainstem aura, retinal migraine, \nophthalmoplegic migraine) and secondary causes need to be excluded. Additional features \nof an aura that raise concern for an underlying vascular etiology include late age of onset, \nshort duration, evolution of the focal symptoms, negative rather than positive visual \nphenomenon, and history of vascular risk factors. \n\nIndividuals presenting with a new migraine with aura (especially an atypical or complex aura) \ncan mimic a transient ischemic attack or an acute stroke. If there is a new neurologic deficit, \nimaging should be guided by concern for cerebrovascular disease, not that the individual has \na headache. (97,98) \n\nDefinitions \nMoCA \u2013 The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed as a rapid screening \ninstrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention \nand concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, \nconceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. MoCA differs from the MMSE mainly by \nincluding tests of executive function and abstraction, and by putting less weight on \norientation to time and place. Ten of the MMSE's 30 points are scored solely on the time-\nplace orientation test, whereas the MoCA assigns it a maximum of six points. The MoCA \nalso puts more weight on recall and attention-calculation performance, while de-emphasizing \nlanguage skill. Time to administer the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible \nscore is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal. \n\nCT and developmental delay \u2013 Significant developmental delay is defined as significant \ndelay (more than two standard deviations below the mean) in one or more developmental \ndomains: gross/fine motor, speech/language, cognition, social/personal, and activities of \ndaily living. Isolated delay in social/language development is characteristic of autism \nspectrum disorders or hearing loss. Isolated delay in motor development is characteristic of \ncerebral palsy (a static encephalopathy) or myopathy. Global developmental delay (GDD) is \na subset of developmental delay defined as significant delay (by at least 2 SD\u2019s) in two or \nmore developmental categories. Note that the term \u201cGDD\u201d is usually reserved for children < \n5 years old, whereas in older children > 5 years, disability is quantifiable with IQ testing. \n\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69482/Narrative/\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/3102253/Narrative/\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69478/Narrative/\n\n\n \n\nPage 17 of 28 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 002 for Brain CT \n\nLeptomeningeal Carcinomatosis \nLeptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (86,99,100,101) \u2013 Leptomeningeal metastasis is an \nuncommon and typically late complication of cancer with poor prognosis and limited \ntreatment options. Diagnosis is often challenging with nonspecific presenting symptoms \nranging from headache and confusion to focal neurologic deficits such as cranial nerve \npalsies. Standard diagnostic evaluation involves a neurologic examination, MRI of the brain \nand spine with gadolinium, and cytologic evaluation of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). \nHematologic malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma), primary brain tumors as well as solid \nmalignancies can spread to the leptomeninges. The most common solid tumors giving rise to \nLM are breast cancer (12 - 35%), small and non-small cell lung cancer (10-26%), melanoma \n(5 -25%), gastrointestinal malignancies (4-14 %), and cancers of unknown primary (1-7%). \n\nDrop Metastases \nDrop Metastases \u2013 Drop metastases are intradural extramedullary spinal metastases that \narise from intracranial lesions. Common examples of intracranial neoplasms that result in \ndrop metastases include pineal tumors, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, germinomas, \nprimitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), glioblastomas multiform, anaplastic \nastrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and less commonly choroid plexus neoplasms and \nteratomas. (102) \n\nMeningitis \nCT scan and Meningitis \u2013 In suspected bacterial meningitis, CT with contrast may be \nperformed before lumbar puncture (LP) to show preliminary meningeal enhancement. It is \nimportant to evaluate for a mass lesion or cause of elevated ICP that would contraindicate \nan LP. CT may be used to define the pathology of the base of the skull and that may require \ntherapeutic intervention and surgical consultation. Some causes of an intracranial infection \ninclude fractures of the paranasal sinus and inner ear infection.  \n\nNormal Pressure Hydrocephalus \nCT and Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) \u2013 Although diagnosis can be made based \non CT findings alone, MRI is more accurate for disclosing associated pathologies (such as \ncerebrovascular disease), excluding other potential etiologies, and for detecting NPH typical \nsigns of prognostic value. A CT scan can exclude NPH and is appropriate for screening \npurposes and in individuals who cannot undergo MRI. \n\nMacrocephaly \nCT for Macrocephaly \u2013 Consider ultrasound in infants with macrocephaly and a normal \nneurological examination, no evidence of increased ICP and an open anterior fontanelle. If \n\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69481/Narrative/\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69485/Narrative/\nhttps://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/cns.pdf\n\n\n \n\nPage 18 of 28 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 002 for Brain CT \n\nhead US is normal, the infant should be monitored closely. (103) The anterior fontanelle \ngenerally closes between 10 and 24 months of age, with 3% closing between 5-9 months \nand 11% after 24 months. (104) \n\nCongenital Abnormalities \nCT scan for congenital abnormalities \u2013 While MRI is preferred to CT for evaluation of \nmost congenital CNS abnormalities, in some clinical situations CT is preferred \n(craniosynostosis) or equivalent to MRI. CT is appropriate in the follow-up of hydrocephalus \nor VP shunt function where the etiology of hydrocephalus has been previously determined or \nin individuals for which MRI evaluation would require general anesthesia. \n\nAnosmia \nAnosmia \u2013 There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT head in the evaluation of \nthe olfactory nerve. \n\nCranial Nerves \nCT for evaluation of the cranial nerves \u2013 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered \nthe gold standard in the study and evaluation of the cranial nerves. Computed tomography \n(CT) allows, usually, an indirect view of the nerve and is useful to demonstrate the \nintraosseous segments of cranial nerves, the foramina through which they exit skull base, \nand their pathologic changes. In optic neuritis, CT has limited utility. Contrast-enhanced CT \nscanning of the orbits may help exclude other orbital pathology. CT scanning of the brain, \nregardless of whether intravenous contrast material is administered or not, does not yield \nprognostic and treatment-altering information. In Bell\u2019s Palsy temporal bone CT is useful in \nthe evaluation of the caliber and the course of the IAC and bony facial nerve canal in the \ntemporal bone. When using CT to evaluate the facial nerve, pathology often can only be \ninferred by visualization of erosion or destruction of the adjacent bony facial nerve canal. In \ncontrast, MRI visualizes soft tissues well and so is better suited for evaluating soft tissue \nfacial nerve abnormalities. \n\nTumors \nCT and tumors \u2013 MRI is the ideal modality to follow-up meningioma, pituitary tumors, low \ngrade tumors, neurocutaneous syndromes, and staging/surveillance for non-CNS cancers. \nCT should only be used when MRI is contraindicated or is unable to be obtained. \nSurveillance timelines should follow NCCN guidelines. Imaging is also warranted if the \nindividual is symptomatic or there are new/changing signs or symptoms or complicating \nfactors. \n\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69481/Narrative/\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69485/Narrative/\nhttps://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/cns.pdf\n\n\n \n\nPage 19 of 28 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 002 for Brain CT \n\nHead Trauma \nCT scan for Head Trauma \u2013 Most types of head injury are minor injuries; clinical signs and \nsymptoms help predict the need for brain CT following injury. CT has advantages in \nevaluating head injury due to its sensitivity for demonstrating mass effect, ventricular size \nand configuration, bone injuries, and acute hemorrhage. An individual who presents with \ncertain clinical risk factors may be more likely to benefit from CT imaging. Some of the \nclinical risk factors that may be used as a guide to predict the probability of abnormal CT \nfollowing minor head injury are vomiting, skull fracture, and age greater than 60 years. \nIndividuals with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15 or less who also have been vomiting or have a \nsuspected skull fracture are likely to show abnormal results on CT scan. CT is also useful in \ndetecting delayed hematoma, hypoxic-ischemic lesions, or cerebral edema in the first 72 \nhours after head injury. \n\nCentral Venous Thrombosis \nCT and Central Venous Thrombosis \u2013 A CTV or MRV is indicated for the definite \nevaluation of a central venous thrombosis/dural sinus thrombosis. The most frequent \npresentations are isolated headache, intracranial hypertension syndrome (headache, \nnausea/vomiting, transient visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus, CN VI palsy, papilledema), \n(105) seizures, focal neurological deficits, and encephalopathy. Risk factors are \nhypercoagulable states inducing genetic prothrombotic conditions, antiphospholipid \nsyndrome and other acquired prothrombotic diseases (such as cancer), oral contraceptives, \npregnancy, puerperium (6-weeks postpartum), infections, and trauma. COVID-19 infection is \nassociated with hypercoagulability, a thromboinflammatory response, and an increased \nincidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) (106,107). Since venous thrombosis can \ncause SAH, infarctions, and hemorrhage, parenchymal imaging with MRI/CT is also \nappropriate (21,108,109). \n\nStroke/TIA \nImaging for Stroke \u2013 Individuals presenting with symptoms of acute stroke should receive \nprompt imaging to determine whether they are candidates for treatment with tissue \nplasminogen activator. Non-contrast CT can evaluate for hemorrhage that would exclude the \nindividual from reperfusion therapy. Functional imaging can be used to select individuals for \nthrombolytic therapy by measuring the mismatch between \u201cinfarct core\u201d and \u201cischemic \npenumbra\u201d and may define ischemic areas of the brain with the potential to respond \npositively to reperfusion therapy. Contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) may follow the \nnon-contrast CT imaging to identify areas of large vessel stenosis or occlusion which may be \na target for therapy. \n\nRecent stroke or transient ischemic attack \u2013 When revascularization therapy is not \nindicated or available in patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA, the focus of the work-up is \non secondary prevention. Both stroke and TIA should have an evaluation for high-risk \nmodifiable factors such as carotid stenosis atrial fibrillation as the cause of ischemic \nsymptoms (110). Diagnostic recommendations include neuroimaging evaluation as soon as \n\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69479/Narrative/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482476/\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/3111293/Narrative/\n\n\n \n\nPage 20 of 28 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 002 for Brain CT \n\npossible, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging, including DWI; noninvasive imaging \nof the extracranial vessels should be performed, and noninvasive imaging of intracranial \nvessels is reasonable. (111) \nPatients with a history of stroke and recent work-up with new signs or symptoms indicating \nprogression or complications of the initial CVA should have repeat brain imaging as an initial \nstudy. Patients with remote or silent strokes discovered on imaging should be evaluated for \nhigh-risk modifiable risk factors based on the location and type of the presumed etiology of \nthe brain injury. \n\nNeurological Deficits \nNeurological Deficits \u2013 Examples of abnormal reflexes related to upper motor neuron \nlesion/central pathology include hyperreflexia, clonus, Hoffman sign and Babinski, snout, \npalmar grasp, and rooting reflexes. \nVisual loss has many possible etiologies, and MRI or CT is only indicated in suspected \nneurological causes of visual loss based on history and exam. Visual field defects, such as \nbitemporal hemianopsia, homonymous hemianopsia, or quadranopsia, require imaging as \nwell as does suspected optic nerve pathology. Subjective symptoms such as blurred vision \nor double vision with no clear correlate on neurological examination requires a \ncomprehensive eye evaluation to exclude more common causes, such as cataracts, \nrefractive errors, retinopathy, glaucoma, or macular degeneration. Transient visual loss with \nhistory consistent with TIA but normal exam at time of examination also should be imaged. \nPositive visual phenomena, such as photopsias or scintillations that march across the visual \nfield, suggest migraine whereas negative phenomenon, such as shaded or blurred, is more \ncharacteristic of ischemia. \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Updated references \n\n\u25cf Updated background section \n\u25cf Updated combination section \n\n Added \n\u25cf Updated Cancer sections \n\u25cf Vertigo with progressive unilateral hearing loss or tinnitus \n\u25cf Known Moyamoya disease or reversible cerebral \n\nvasoconstriction with any new or changing neurological signs \nor symptoms (also to (Bran CT /CTA combo) \n\n\u25cf Thunderclap headache >6 hours after onset in an acute \nsetting with high suspicion of SAH (Brain CT/CTA combo) \n\nDeleted \n\u25cf Tumor monitoring in neurocutaneous syndromes \n\u25cf Pulsatile tinnitus combo section \n\nhttps://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/cervical-dystonia/\nhttps://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/cervical-dystonia/\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69509/Narrative/\n\n\n \n\nPage 21 of 28 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 002 for Brain CT \n\nMay 2023 Updated and reformatted references \nUpdated background section \nReorganized indications \nGeneral Information moved to beginning of guideline with added \nstatement on clinical indications not addressed in this guideline \nAdded: \n\n\u25cf Indeterminate imaging section \n\u25cf Lesion with atypical features for further evaluation or follow up \n\u25cf Initial evaluation for a known syrinx or syringomyelia \n\n\u25cb Bulbar and Pseudobulbar symptoms to match Brain MRI \nClarified: \n\n\u25cf Abnormal reflexes (pathological, asymmetric, hyperreflexia) \n\u25cf New onset headache - Related to activity or event (sexual \n\nactivity,    \n\u25cf exertion, Valsalva, position), new or progressively worsening \n\u25cf Tumor surveillance as per professional society \n\nrecommendations \n\u25cf Brain CT/Brain CTA - Headache associated with exercise, \n\nexertion, \n\u25cf Valsalva or sexual activity \n\nDeleted: \n\u25cf Anosmia (loss of smell) or dysosmia documented by objective \n\ntesting that is persistent and of unknown origin \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nTemporal bone, mastoid, orbits, sella and internal auditory canal computed tomography (CT) \nis performed for problems, such as conductive hearing loss, chronic otitis media, mastoiditis, \ncholesteatoma, congenital hearing loss and cochlear implants. It is a modality of choice \nbecause it provides 3D positional information and offers a high degree of anatomic detail. It \nis rarely used for evaluation of VIIth or VIIIth nerve tumors. \n\nINDICATIONS FOR SELLA CT (1) \nSella CT \nWhen MRI is contraindicated or cannot be performed (2,3) \n\n\u25cf For further evaluation of known sellar and parasellar masses \n\n\u25cf Suspected pituitary gland disorder (4) based on any of the following: \n\n\u25cb Documented visual field defect suggesting compression of the optic chiasm; \nOR \n\n\u25cb Laboratory findings suggesting pituitary dysfunction (5); OR \n\n\u25cb Pituitary apoplexy with sudden onset of neurological and hormonal symptoms; \nOR \n\n\u25cb Other imaging suggesting sella (pituitary) mass \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 11 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 006-1 for Temporal Bone, Mastoid, Orbits, Sella, Internal Auditory Canal CT \n\nINDICATIONS FOR \nTEMPORAL/MASTOID/INTERNAL AUDITORY \nCANAL CT \nHearing Loss (Documented on Audiogram) (6,7) \n\n\u25cf Asymmetric sensorineural when MRI is contraindicated (8,9) \n\n\u25cf Conductive or mixed (10) \n\n\u25cf Congenital (10) \n\n\u25cf Cochlear implant evaluation (11,12,13,14) \n\nNote: For congenital/childhood sensorineural hearing loss suspected to be due to a \nstructural abnormality, CT is the preferred imaging modality for the osseous structures and \nmalformations of the inner ear.

For general screening, MRI brain with IAC/MRA brain \nand neck is approvable. If IIIH is suspected (typically with headache and vision changes in a \nyounger woman with a high BMI) MRI/MRV brain is indicated. If there is concern for vascular \netiology, CTA or MRA brain/neck is indicated. If there is associated hearing loss and \nneurological signs/symptoms, MRI brain with IAC is indicated.  If the temporal bone is \nsuspected to be involved and/or retrotympanic lesion is seen on otoscopy, CT temporal \nbone/IAC is indicated. If there is concurrent concern for boney and a vascular issue, CTA of \nthe head and neck can be used to evaluate both. \n\nContraindication and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine \n\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/69488/Narrative\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/3094199/Narrative/\nhttp://www.emdocs.net/acute-mastoiditis-pearls-and-pitfalls/\n\n\n \n\nPage 8 of 11 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 006-1 for Temporal Bone, Mastoid, Orbits, Sella, Internal Auditory Canal CT \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nMay 2024 \u25cf Updated references and background \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and preferred studies section added to the \nbackground \n\n\u25cf Added pulsatile tinnitus with concern for osseous pathology of \nthe temporal bone or a retrotympanic lesion seen on otoscopy  \n\nApril 2023 \u25cf Updated references \n\u25cf Added: \n\n\u25cb Note on congenital hearing loss \n\u25cb Section on further evaluation of indeterminate or \n\nquestionable findings on prior imaging \n\u25cb General Information moved to beginning of guideline \n\nwith added statement on clinical indications not \naddressed in this guideline \n\n\u25cf Clarified: \n\u25cb There should be a high suspicion of CSF leak or \n\nconfirmatory CSF fluid laboratory testing (Beta-2 \ntransferrin assay) \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nSinus/Maxillofacial Computed tomography (CT) primarily provides information about bony \nstructures but may also be useful in evaluating soft tissue masses. It can help document the \nextent of facial bone fractures, facial infections, masses and abscesses. The primary role of \nCT scans is to aid in the diagnosis and management of recurrent and chronic sinusitis, or to \ndefine the anatomy of the sinuses prior to surgery.   \n\nSpecial Note \nA single authorization for CPT codes 70486, 70487, 70488, or 76380 includes imaging of the \nentire maxillofacial area, including face and sinuses. Multiple authorizations are not required. \n\nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in the State of Washington. \n\nINDICATIONS \nSinusitis  \nRhinosinusitis \n\n\u25cf Clinical suspicion of fungal infection (1,2,3) \n\n\u25cf Clinical suspicion of complications, such as (3,4): \n\n\u25cb Preseptal, orbital, or intracranial infection (5) \n\n\u25cb Osteomyelitis \n\n\u25cb Cavernous sinus thrombosis \n\n\u25cf Acute (< 4 weeks) or subacute (4-12 weeks) sinusitis (presumed infectious) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 009 for Sinus Maxillofacial CT, Limited or Localized Follow Up Sinus CT \n\n\u25cb Not responding to medical management including 2 or more courses of \nantibiotics in the past 3 months \n\n\u25cf Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis with 4 or more annual episodes without persistent \nsymptoms in-between \n\n\u25cf Chronic recurrent sinusitis (6) (> 12 weeks) \n\n\u25cb Not responding to medical management* and with at least two of the following: \n\n\u25a0 Mucopurulent discharge \n\n\u25a0 Nasal obstruction and congestion \n\n\u25a0 Facial pain, pressure, and fullness \n\n\u25a0 Decreased or absent sense of smell \n\n\u25cb With nasal polyps especially unilateral polyps, concern for polyps extending \noutside of the nasal cavity, or other atypical presentations (6) \n\n*NOTE: Medical management for chronic sinusitis includes nasal saline irrigation and/or \ntopical intranasal steroids.

Viral infections \ncause the majority of acute rhinosinusitis and only 0.5 percent to 2 percent progress to \nbacterial infections. Most acute rhinosinusitis resolves without treatment in two weeks. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 10 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 009 for Sinus Maxillofacial CT, Limited or Localized Follow Up Sinus CT \n\nUncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis is generally diagnosed clinically and does not require a \nsinus CT scan or other imaging. Antibiotics are not recommended for patients with \nuncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis who have mild illness and assurance of follow-up. If a \ndecision is made to treat, amoxicillin with clavulanate should be first-line antibiotic treatment \nfor most acute rhinosinusitis. If improvement is not demonstrated, it is recommended to \nchange antibiotics to either high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate, doxycycline, a \nfluoroquinolone such as moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, or a dual treatment of clindamycin plus \na third-generation oral cephalosporin. (3) \n\nCOVID-19 \nAnosmia and dysgeusia have been reported as common early symptoms in patients with \nCOVID-19, occurring in greater than 80 percent of patients. For isolated anosmia, imaging is \ntypically not needed once the diagnosis of COVID has been made, given the high \nassociation. As such, COVID testing should be done prior to imaging.

All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nHigh resolution CT can visualize both normal and pathologic anatomy of the neck. It is used \nin the evaluation of neck soft tissues, masses, abscesses, and lymphadenopathy. Neck CT \nadditionally provides details about the larynx, cervical trachea and pathologic conditions of \nthe airway. \n\nINDICATIONS \nSuspected Tumor or Cancer \n\n\u25cf Suspicious lesions in mouth or throat (1) \n\n\u25cf Suspicious tumor or cancer mass/tumor found on another imaging study and needing \nclarification (2)         \n\nNeck Mass or Lymphadenopathy (not parotid or thyroid region) \n\u25cf Present on physical exam and remains non-diagnostic after ultrasound is completed \n\n(1) \n\n\u25cf Mass or abnormality found on other imaging study and needing further evaluation \n\n\u25cf Increased risk for malignancy (2) with one or more of the following findings (3): \n\n\u25cb Fixation to adjacent tissues \n\n\u25cb Firm consistency \n\n\u25cb Size > 1.5 cm \n\n\u25cb Ulceration of overlying skin \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 12 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 008-1 for Neck CT \n\n\u25cb Mass present \u2265 two weeks (or uncertain duration) without significant \nfluctuation and not considered of infectious cause \n\n\u25cb History of cancer \n\n\u25cf Failed 2 weeks of treatment for suspected infectious adenopathy (3,4) \n\n\u25cf Pediatric (\u2264 18 years old) considerations (5) \n\n\u25cb Ultrasound should be inconclusive or suspicious unless there is a history of \nmalignancy (6) \n\nNote: For discrete cystic lesions of the neck, an ultrasound should be performed as initial \nimaging unless there is a high suspicion of malignancy \n\nNeck Mass (parotid region) \n\u25cf Parotid mass found on other imaging study and needing further evaluation \n\nNote: US is the initial imaging study of a parotid region mass to determine if the location is \ninside or outside the gland (2,7) \n\nNeck Mass (thyroid region) \n\u25cf Staging and monitoring for recurrence of known thyroid cancer (8) \n\n\u25cf To assess extent of thyroid tissue when other imaging suggests extension through \nthe thoracic inlet into the mediastinum or concern for airway compression (9) \n\nNote: US is the initial imaging study of a thyroid region mass. Biopsy is usually the next step. \nIn the evaluation of known thyroid malignancy, CT is preferred over MRI since there is less \nrespiratory motion artifact. Chest CT may be included for preoperative assessment in some \ncases. \n\nFollow-up of Known Tumor or Cancer (10) \nFor malignancies not listed, Neck CT is only indicated when there are signs or symptoms of \nneck involvement (such as palpable masses/lymph nodes or dysphagia)  \n\nInitial Staging \n\u25cf Neck CT is indicated for initial diagnostic workup for the following cancer types: \n\n\u25cb Head and neck cancers \n\n\u25cb Thyroid cancer \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 12 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 008-1 for Neck CT \n\n\u25cb B cell lymphomas (follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B

Pediatric aggressive mature B cell lymphomas (Burkitt lymphoma, Diffuse \nlarge B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma) \n\n\u25cb Occult primary \n\nRestaging \n\u25cf Neck CT is indicated during active treatment (every 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy or \n\nimmunotherapy, following radiation and/or after surgery) for the following \nmalignancies: \n\n\u25cb Head and neck cancers (and after radiation treatment) \n\n\u25cb Thyroid cancer (and after surgery and/or if any concern for recurrence or \nprogression) \n\n\u25cb ALL \n\n\u25cb AML \n\n\u25cb B Cell lymphomas (follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Burkitt \nlymphoma, B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative \ndisorders) \n\n\u25cb Hodgkin lymphoma (pediatric and adult) \n\n\u25cb Pediatric aggressive mature B cell lymphomas (Burkitt lymphoma, Diffuse \nlarge B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma) \n\n\u25cb Occult primary \n\nSurveillance  \n\u25cf Neck CT is appropriate during surveillance for the following malignancies at the \n\nintervals defined below: \n\n\u25cb ALL if lymphomatous features present, every 3-6 months for 2 years \n\n\u25cb AML if extramedullary disease present, every 3-6 months for 2 years \n\n\u25cb B Cell lymphomas (pediatric and adult) every 6 months for 2 years then \nannually as clinically indicated \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 6 of 12 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 008-1 for Neck CT \n\n\u25cb Head and Neck cancer annually when specified that the area of original \ndisease is difficult to follow on direct visualization (surveillance is typically with \nexam/scope rather than imaging) \n\n\u25cb Hodgkin lymphoma (pediatric and adult) every 3-6 months for 2 years \n\n\u25cb Occult primary every 3-6 months for 2 years, every 6-12 months for 3 years \nthen annually \n\nNote: There would need to be a sign or symptom of recurrence to consider Neck CT when \nthe timeframe above for routine surveillance has elapsed OR when a cancer is not listed \nabove because neck CT is not routinely a part of surveillance for that cancer in an \nasymptomatic patient.  \n\nOther Indications \n\u25cf Known or suspected deep space infection or abscesses of the pharynx or neck with \n\nsigns or symptoms of infection (11) \n\n\u25cf Sialadenitis (infection and inflammation of the salivary glands)

With the \nrise of human papillomavirus-related oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers in adults, \ncontrast-enhanced neck CT has become more important for the evaluation of a neck mass, \ndeemed at risk for malignancy, surpassing ultrasound for the initial evaluation in many \ncases. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery recently issued \nstrong recommendations for neck CT or MRI, emphasizing the importance of a timely \ndiagnosis.

documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nIndications for performing computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the head/brain \nregion. \n\nNOTE: Authorization for CT Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging. The term \nangiography refers to both arteriography and venography \n\nSpecial Note \nBrain CT/CTA are not approvable simultaneously unless they meet the criteria described \nbelow in the Indications for Brain CT/Brain CTA combination studies section. If there is a \ncombination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the same time or \nsequentially (within the past 3 months) the results of the prior study should be: \n\n\u25cf Inconclusive or show a need for additional or follow up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient. \n\n(*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR BRAIN CTA \nEvaluation of Suspected Intracranial Vascular Disease (1,2) \nAneurysm Screening \n\n\u25cf Screening for intracranial aneurysm if two or more first-degree family members \n(parent, brother, sister, or child) of intracranial aneurysm (1) \n\n\u25cb Note: Repeat study is recommended every 5-7 years (3) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 004-1 for Brain CTA \n\n\u25cf For one first degree relative with aneurysm, asymptomatic screening is not indicated \n- would require a neurological sign or symptom supporting clinical concern for \naneurysm. (4,5,6) \n\n\u25cf Screening for aneurysm in high-risk populations (1,7,8,9,10,11,12):  \n\n\u25cb KNOWN genetic syndromes (see Genetic Syndromes and Rare Diseases) \n\n\u25cb Bicuspid aortic valve  \n\n\u25cb Known aortic diseases (aneurysm, coarctation, dissection)  \n\nVascular Abnormalities  \n\u25cf Suspected vascular malformation (arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or dural \n\narteriovenous fistula) in patient with previous or indeterminate imaging study (2) \n\n\u25cf Thunderclap headache with continued concern for underlying vascular abnormality \n(i.e., aneurysm or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome) after initial negative \nbrain imaging. (13,14,15,16) \n\n\u25cb Note: Negative brain CT < 6 hours after headache onset excludes \nsubarachnoid hemorrhage in neurologically intact patients (15).

With its three-dimensional \nreconstructions, CTA can simultaneously demonstrate the bony skull base and its related \nvasculature. CTA's use of ionizing radiation and an iodine-based intravascular contrast \nmedium is a disadvantage when compared to magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), but \nit is quicker and requires less patient cooperation than MRA. CTA is much less invasive than \ncatheter angiography which involves injecting contrast material into an artery. \n\nCTA and Non-Aneurysmal Vascular Malformations  \nNon-aneurysmal vascular malformations can be divided into low flow vascular malformations \nand high flow vascular malformations. Low flow vascular malformations include dural venous \nanomalies (DVA), cavernomas, and capillary telangiectasias. High flow vascular \nmalformations include AVM and dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF). For low flow \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 10 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 004-1 for Brain CTA \n\nmalformations, MRI is the study of choice. There is limited medical literature to support \nvascular imagining (CTA or MRA). CTA plays a limited role in the assessment of cavernoma \nbut may be used to demonstrate a DVA. MRA is not usually helpful in the assessment of \ncavernoma, capillary telangiectasia, and DVA. Vascular imaging is indicated in high flow \nvascular malformations. (1,2,72) \n\nThere is no evidence to support screening of first-degree relatives for AVMs (73). The risk of \nhaving an AVM may be higher than in the general population, but absolute risk is low. \n\nPulsatile tinnitus \nPulsatile tinnitus has many etiologies, and the choice of study should be based on \naccompanying signs and symptoms. For general screening MRI brain with IAC/MRA brain \nand neck is approvable. If IIIH is suspected (typically with headache and vision changes in a \nyounger woman with a high BMI), MRI/MRV brain is indicated. If there is concern for \nvascular etiology, CTA or MRA brain/neck is indicated. If there is associated hearing loss \nand neurological signs/symptoms, MRI brain with IAC is indicated. If the temporal bone is \nsuspected to be involved and/or retrotympanic lesion seen on otoscopy, CT temporal \nbone/IAC is indicated. If there is concurrent concern for boney and a vascular issue, CTA of \nthe head and neck can be used to evaluate both. \n\nMRA vs CTA for CVA  \nPreferred vascular imaging of the head and neck includes non-contrast head MRA and \ncontrast-enhanced neck MRA. MRA may not be able to be performed in patients with \nclaustrophobia, morbid obesity, or implanted device, but it can be useful in patients with \nrenal failure or contrast allergies. In patients with high radiation exposure, MRA as an \nalternative should be considered. For acute stroke, CTA is preferred after CT (to rule of \nhemorrhage) and to look for thrombus/possible intervention that is time sensitive. (2,24) \n\nCTA and Recent Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack  \n\u25cf When revascularization therapy is not indicated or available in patients with an \n\nischemic stroke or TIA, the focus of the work-up is on secondary prevention. Both \nstroke and TIA should have an evaluation for high-risk modifiable factors such as \ncarotid stenosis atrial fibrillation as the cause of ischemic symptoms (74). Diagnostic \nrecommendations include neuroimaging evaluation as soon as possible, preferably \nwith magnetic resonance imaging, including DWI; noninvasive imaging of the \nextracranial vessels should be performed, and noninvasive imaging of intracranial \nvessels is reasonable. (75) \n\n\u25cf Patients with a history of stroke and recent work-up with new signs or symptoms \nindicating progression or complications of the initial CVA should have repeat brain \nimaging as an initial study. Patients with remote or silent strokes discovered on \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 11 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 004-1 for Brain CTA \n\nimaging should be evaluated for high-risk modifiable risk factors based on the \nlocation and type of the presumed etiology of the brain injury. \n\nCTA and Intracerebral Hemorrhage (76) \nCTA is useful as a screening tool for an underlying vascular abnormality in the evaluation of \nspontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Etiologies of spontaneous ICH include tumor, \nvascular malformation, aneurysm, hypertensive arteriopathy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, \nvenous thrombosis, vasculitis, RCVS, drug-induced vasospasm, venous sinus thrombosis, \nMoyamoya disease, anticoagulant use and hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic \ninfarct. History can help point to a specific etiology. Possible risk factors for the presence of \nunderlying vascular abnormalities include age younger than 65, female, lobar or \nintraventricular location, and the absence of hypertension or impaired coagulation. \n\nCTV and Central Venous Thrombosis** \nCT Venogram is indicated for the evaluation of a central venous thrombosis/dural sinus \nthrombosis. The most frequent presentations are isolated headache, intracranial \nhypertension syndrome, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and encephalopathy. Risk \nfactors are hypercoagulable states inducing genetic prothrombotic conditions, \nantiphospholipid syndrome and other acquired prothrombotic diseases, such as cancer, oral \ncontraceptives, pregnancy, puerperium (6 weeks postpartum), infections, and trauma. Since \nvenous thrombosis can cause SAH, infarctions, and hemorrhage, parenchymal imaging with \nMRI/CT is also appropriate. (31,77,78,79) \n\nCTA and Dissection \nCraniocervical dissections can be spontaneous or traumatic. Patients with blunt head or \nneck trauma who meet Denver Screening criteria should be assessed for cerebrovascular \ninjury (although about 20% will not meet criteria). The criteria include: focal or lateralizing \nneurological deficits (not explained by head CT), infarct on head CT, face, basilar skull, or \ncervical spine fractures, cervical hematomas that are not expanding, Glasgow coma score \nless than 8 without CT findings, massive epistaxis, cervical bruit or thrill. (62,80,81,82) \n\nSpontaneous dissection presents with headache, neck pain with neurological signs or \nsymptoms. There is often minor trauma or precipitating factor (i.e., exercise, neck \nmanipulation). Dissection is thought to occur due to weakness of the vessel wall, and there \nmay be an underlying connective tissue disorder. Dissection of the extracranial vessels can \nextend intracranially and/or lead to thrombus which can migrate into the intracranial \ncirculation causing ischemia. Therefore, vascular imaging of the head and neck is warranted. \n(63,83) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 12 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 004-1 for Brain CTA \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester). \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds weight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\nAcronyms / Abbreviations \nADPKD: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease \nAVM: Arteriovenous Malformation  \nCNS: Central Nervous System \nCTA: Computed Tomography Angiography \nCTV: Computed Tomography Venography  \nCVA: Cerebrovascular Accident \ndAVF: Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas  \nDVA: Dural Venous Anomalies  \nIAC: Internal Auditory Canal \nICH: Intracerebral Hemorrhage  \nMRA: Magnetic Resonance Angiography \nMRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging \nMRV: Magnetic Resonance Venography  \nSCAD: Spontaneous Coronary Arteries Dissection  \nSAH: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage   \nVBI: Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency  \nTIA: Transient Ischemic Attack \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Updated references \n\n\u25cf Updated background section \n\u25cf Updated combination section \n\u25cf Clarified  \n\n\u25cb Frequency of screening in genetic syndromes \n\u25cf Added \n\n\u25cb Screening for aneurysm in high-risk populations \n\u25cb Bicuspid aortic valve \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 13 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 004-1 for Brain CTA \n\nDate Summary \n\u25cb Known aortic diseases (aneurysm, coarctation, \n\ndissection) \n\u25cb Suspected cerebral vasospasm \n\u25cb Suspected carotid or vertebral artery dissection;

CTA is quicker in the acute setting and MRA is an \nexcellent screening test since it does not utilize ionizing radiation (36) \n\nMRA vs CTA for Carotid Artery Evaluation (37,38) \nDuplex ultrasound and contrast-MRA is a common choice for carotid artery evaluation. \nLimitations of MRA include difficulty in patients with claustrophobia and the risk of \nnephrogenic systemic sclerosis with gadolinium contrast agents in specific patients. \nAdvantages of CTA over MRA include superior spatial resolution, rapid image acquisition, \ndecreased susceptibility to motion artifacts and artifacts from calcification as well as being \nbetter able to evaluate slow flow and tandem lesions. However, CTA can also overestimate \nhigh-grade stenosis. Limitations of CTA include radiation exposure to the patient, necessity \nof IV contrast, and risk of contrast allergy and contrast nephropathy.  \n\nCTA and Dissection \nCraniocervical dissections can be spontaneous or traumatic. Patients with blunt head or \nneck trauma who meet Denver Screening criteria should be assessed for cerebrovascular \ninjury (although about 20% will not meet criteria). The criteria include: focal or lateralizing \nneurological deficits (not explained by head CT), infarct on head CT, face, basilar skull, or \ncervical spine fractures, cervical hematomas that are not expanding, Glasgow coma score \nless than 8 without CT findings, massive epistaxis, cervical bruit or thrill.(19,39,40,41) \nSpontaneous dissection presents with headache, neck pain with neurological signs or \nsymptoms. There is often minor trauma or precipitating factor (e.g., exercise, neck \nmanipulation). Dissection is thought to occur due to weakness of the vessel wall, and there \nmay be an underlying connective tissue disorder. Dissection of the extracranial vessels can \nextend intracranially and/or lead to thrombus, which can migrate into the intracranial \ncirculation causing ischemia. Therefore, MRA of the head and neck is warranted. (20,42,43) \n\nCTA and Recent Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack \n\u25cf When revascularization therapy is not indicated or available in patients with an \n\nischemic stroke or TIA, the focus of the work-up is on secondary prevention. Both \nstroke and TIA should have an evaluation for high-risk modifiable factors such as \ncarotid stenosis atrial fibrillation as the cause of ischemic symptoms (44). Diagnostic \nrecommendations include neuroimaging evaluation as soon as possible, preferably \nwith magnetic resonance imaging, including DWI; noninvasive imaging of the \nextracranial vessels should be performed, and noninvasive imaging of intracranial \nvessels is reasonable. (45) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 9 of 13 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 012-1 for Neck CTA \n\n\u25cf Patients with a history of stroke and recent work-up with new signs or symptoms \nindicating progression or complications of the initial CVA should have repeat brain \nimaging as an initial study. Patients with remote or silent strokes discovered on \nimaging should be evaluated for high-risk modifiable risk factors based on the \nlocation and type of the presumed etiology of the brain injury.  \n\nAcronyms \nCT: Computed tomography \nCTA: Computed tomography angiography \nCVA: Cerebrovascular accident \nFMD: Fibromuscular dysplasia \nMR: Magnetic Resonance \nMRA: Magnetic resonance angiography \nMRI: Magnetic resonance imaging \nSCAD: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection \nTIA: Transient Ischemic Attack \nUS: Ultrasound \nVBI: Vertebrobasilar insufficiency \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester). \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds weight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Updated references \n\n\u25cf Updated background section \n\u25cf Updated combination section \n\u25cf Clarified \n\n\u25cb Frequency of screening in genetic syndromes \n\u25cf Added \n\n\u25cb Follow-up of known carotid or vertebral artery dissection \nwithin 3-6 months for evaluation of recanalization and/or to \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 10 of 13 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 012-1 for Neck CTA \n\nDate Summary \nguide anticoagulation treatment (already in combo) \n\n\u25cb Horner\u2019s syndrome, non-central (miosis, ptosis, and \nanhidrosis) - also in combo section  \n\n\u25cb Giant cell arteritis with suspected intracranial and \nextracranial involvement - also in combo section  \n\n\u25cb Genetic syndromes and rare disease section \n\u25cf Deleted \n\n\u25cb Aneurysm screening section  \n\u25cb Pulsatile tinnitus combo section  \n\nMay 2023 \u25cf Updated References \n\u25cf Added \n\n\u25cb For further evaluation of a congenital vascular \nmalformation of the head and neck \n\n\u25cb Follow-up of known carotid or vertebral artery dissection \nwithin 3-6 months for evaluation of recanalization and/or to \nguide anticoagulation treatment (Combo Neck/Brain CTA) \n\n\u25cb Section on further evaluation of indeterminate or \nquestionable findings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cb General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in \nthis guideline \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

014 for Sinus, Face, Orbit, Neck, and Internal Auditory Canal MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used in the evaluation of orbit, face and neck region \nmasses, trauma, and infection. The soft tissue contrast between normal and abnormal \ntissues provided by MRI is sensitive for differentiating between inflammatory disease and \nmalignant tumors and permits the precise delineation of tumor margins. MRI is used for \ntherapy planning and follow- up of face and neck neoplasms. It is also used for the \nevaluation of neck lymphadenopathy and vocal cord lesions. \n\nSpecial Note \nIf there is a combination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the same \ntime or sequentially (within the past 3 months) the results of the prior study should be: \n\n\u25cf Inconclusive or show a need for additional or follow up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient. \n\n(*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nLegislative Requirements \nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in the State of Washington \n\nINDICATIONS FOR ORBIT MRI \nMRI is superior for the evaluation of the visual pathways, globe and soft tissues; CT is \npreferred for visualizing bony detail and calcifications (1,2) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 19 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 014 for Sinus, Face, Orbit, Neck, and Internal Auditory Canal MRI \n\nOrbit MRI \n\u25cf Abnormal external or direct eye exam \n\n\u25cb Exophthalmos (proptosis) or enophthalmos \n\n\u25cb Ophthalmoplegia with concern for orbital pathology \n\n\u25cb Unilateral optic disk swelling (3,4,5) \n\n\u25cb Documented visual field defect (6,7,8) \n\n\u25a0 Unilateral or with abnormal optic disc(s) (e.g., optic disc blurring, \nedema, or pallor);

MRI is not considered the first-line study for \nroutine sinus imaging because of limitations in the definition of the bony anatomy and length \nof imaging time. MRI for confirmation of diagnosis of sinusitis is discouraged because of \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 13 of 19 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 014 for Sinus, Face, Orbit, Neck, and Internal Auditory Canal MRI \n\nhypersensitivity (overdiagnosis) in comparison to CT without contrast. MRI, however, is \nsuperior to CT in differentiating inflammatory conditions from neoplastic processes. MRI may \nbetter depict intraorbital and intracranial complications in cases of aggressive sinus infection, \nas well as differentiating soft-tissue masses from inflammatory mucosal disease. MRI may \nalso identify fungal invasive sinusitis or encephaloceles. \n\nAnosmia \nNonstructural causes of anosmia include post viral symptoms, medications (Amitriptyline, \nEnalapril, Nifedipine, Propranolol, Penicillamine, Sumatriptan, Cisplatin, Trifluoperazine, \nPropylthiouracil). These should be considered prior to advanced imaging to look for a \nstructural cause. Anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported as common early symptoms in \npatients with COVID-19, occurring in greater than 80 percent of patients. For isolated \nanosmia, imaging is typically not needed once the diagnosis of COVID has been made given \nthe high association. As such, COVID testing should be done prior to imaging (65,66,67) MRI \nOrbits, Face, and Neck MRI rather than MRI Brain is the mainstay for directly imaging the \nolfactory apparatus and sinonasal or anterior cranial fossa tumors that may impair or directly \ninvolve the olfactory apparatus. (68) \n\nCSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) Leaks \nFor CSF rhinorrhea, Sinus CT is indicated when looking to characterize a bony defect. For \nCSF otorrhea, Temporal Bone CT is indicated. For intermittent leaks and complex cases, \nconsider CT/MRI/Nuclear Cisternography. There should be a high suspicion or confirmatory \nCSF fluid laboratory testing (Beta-2 transferrin assay). (69,70) \n\nTrigeminal Neuralgia \nAccording to the International Headache Society, Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) is defined as a \ndisorder characterized by recurrent unilateral brief electric shock-like pain, abrupt in onset \nand termination, limited to the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve \nand triggered by innocuous stimuli.

It is an alternative to \ninvasive intra-catheter angiography that was once the mainstay for the investigation of \nintracranial vascular disease. MRA/MRV may use a contrast agent, gadolinium, which is \nnon-iodine-based, for better visualization. It can be used in patients who have history of \ncontrast allergy and who are at high risk of kidney failure. A single authorization covers both \nMRA and MRV. \n\nMRA and Non-Aneurysmal Vascular Malformations  \nNon-aneurysmal vascular malformations can be divided in low flow vascular malformations \nand high flow vascular malformations.  Low flow vascular malformations include dural \nvenous anomalies (DVA), cavernomas, and capillary telangiectasias. High flow vascular \nmalformations include AVM and dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF). For low flow \nmalformations, MRI is the study of choice. There is limited medical literature to support \nvascular imagining (CTA or MRA). CTA plays a limited role in the assessment of cavernoma \nbut may be used to demonstrate a DVA. MRA is not usually helpful in the assessment of \ncavernoma, capillary telangiectasia, and DVA. Vascular imaging is indicated in high flow \nvascular malformations. (1,2,68) \n\nThere is no evidence to support screening of first-degree relatives for AVMs (69). The risk of \nhaving an AVM may be higher than in the general population, but absolute risk is low. \n\nPulsatile tinnitus  \nPulsatile tinnitus has many etiologies, and the choice of study should be based on \naccompanying signs and symptoms. For general screening MRI brain with IAC/MRA brain \nand neck is approvable. If IIIH is suspected (typically with headache and vision changes in a \nyounger woman with a high BMI), MRI/MRV brain is indicated. If there is concern for \nvascular etiology, CTA or MRA brain/neck is indicated. If there is associated hearing loss \nand neurological signs/symptoms, MRI brain with IAC is indicated. If the temporal bone is \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 11 of 21 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 004-2 for Brain MRA_MRV \n\nsuspected to be involved and/or retrotympanic lesion seen on otoscopy, CT temporal \nbone/IAC is indicated. If there is concurrent concern for boney and a vascular issue, CTA of \nthe head and neck can be used to evaluate both. \n\nMRA and Recent Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack  \n\u25cf When revascularization therapy is not indicated or available in patients with an \n\nischemic stroke or TIA, the focus of the work-up is on secondary prevention. Both \nstroke and TIA should have an evaluation for high-risk modifiable factors such as \ncarotid stenosis atrial fibrillation as the cause of ischemic symptoms (70). Diagnostic \nrecommendations include neuroimaging evaluation as soon as possible, preferably \nwith magnetic resonance imaging, including DWI; noninvasive imaging of the \nextracranial vessels should be performed, and noninvasive imaging of intracranial \nvessels is reasonable. (71) \n\n\u25cf Patients with a history of stroke and recent work-up with new signs or symptoms \nindicating progression or complications of the initial CVA should have repeat brain \nimaging as an initial study. Patients with remote or silent strokes discovered on \nimaging should be evaluated for high-risk modifiable risk factors based on the \nlocation and type of the presumed etiology of the brain injury. \n\nMRA vs CTA for CVA  \nPreferred vascular imaging of the head and neck includes non-contrast head MRA and \ncontrast-enhanced neck MRA. MRA may not be able to be performed in patients with \nclaustrophobia, morbid obesity, or implanted device, but it can be useful in patients with \nrenal failure or contrast allergies. In patients with high radiation exposure, MRA as an \nalternative should be considered. For acute stroke, CTA is preferred after CT (to rule of \nhemorrhage) and to look for thrombus/possible intervention that is time-sensitive. (2,22) \n\nMRA and Intracerebral Hemorrhage (72) \nMRA is useful as a screening tool for an underlying vascular abnormality in the evaluation of \nspontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Etiologies of spontaneous ICH include tumor, \nvascular malformation, aneurysm, hypertensive arteriopathy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, \nvenous thrombosis, vasculitis, RCVS, drug-induced vasospasm, venous sinus thrombosis, \nMoyamoya disease, anticoagulant use and hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic \ninfarct. History can help point to a specific etiology. Possible risk factors for the presence of \nunderlying vascular abnormalities include age younger than 65, female, lobar or \nintraventricular location, and the absence of hypertension or impaired coagulation. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 12 of 21 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 004-2 for Brain MRA_MRV \n\nMRV and Central Venous Thrombosis ** \nMR Venogram is indicated for the evaluation of a central venous thrombosis/dural sinus \nthrombosis. The most frequent presentations are isolated headache, intracranial \nhypertension syndrome (headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual obscurations, pulsatile \ntinnitus, CN VI palsy, papilledema) (73), seizures, focal neurological deficits, and \nencephalopathy. Risk factors are hypercoagulable states inducing genetic prothrombotic \nconditions, antiphospholipid syndrome and other acquired prothrombotic diseases (such as \ncancer), oral contraceptives, pregnancy, puerperium (6 weeks postpartum), infections, and \ntrauma. COVID-19 infection is associated with hypercoagulability, a thromboinflammatory \nresponse, and an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) (74,75). Since \nvenous thrombosis can cause SAH, infarctions, and hemorrhage, parenchymal imaging with \nMRI/CT is also appropriate (76,77,78). \n\nMRA and Dissection \nCraniocervical dissections can be spontaneous or traumatic. Patients with blunt head or \nneck trauma who meet Denver Screening criteria should be assessed for cerebrovascular \ninjury (although about 20% will not meet criteria). The criteria include focal or lateralizing \nneurological deficits (not explained by head CT); infarct on head CT; face, basilar skull, or \ncervical spine fractures; cervical hematomas that are not expanding; Glasgow coma score \nless than 8 without CT findings; massive epistaxis; cervical bruit or thrill. (27,79,80) \n\nSpontaneous dissection presents with headache, neck pain with neurological signs or \nsymptoms. There is often minor trauma or precipitating factor (i.e., exercise, neck \nmanipulation). Dissection is thought to occur due to weakness of the vessel wall, and there \nmay be an underlying connective tissue disorder. Dissection of the extracranial vessels can \nextend intracranially and/or lead to thrombus which can migrate into the intracranial \ncirculation, causing ischemia. Therefore, MRA of the head and neck is warranted. (28,81) \n\nMoyamoya Disease \nFamily members of Moyamoya Disease (MMD) patients may also have MMD, but not have \nany obvious symptoms. Routine screening should be implemented for all family members of \nMMD patients. TCD may be the preferred choice for screening because it is inexpensive and \nsafe and as a high diagnostic agreement with MRA.  \n\nCombination MRI/MRA of the Brain  \nThis is one of the most misused combination studies and other than what is indicated above \nthese examinations should be ordered in sequence, not together. Vascular abnormalities \ncan be visualized on the brain MRI. \n\nPatients presenting with a new migraine with aura (especially an atypical or complex aura) \ncan mimic a transient ischemic attack or an acute stroke.

MRA is an excellent screening test since it does not \nutilize ionizing radiation (28) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 8 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 012-2 for Neck MRA_MRV \n\nMRA vs CTA for Carotid Artery Evaluation (49,50) \nDuplex US, CTA and contrast-MRA are common choices for carotid artery evaluation. \nLimitations of MRA include difficulty in patients with claustrophobia and the risk of \nnephrogenic systemic sclerosis with gadolinium contrast agents in specific patients. \nAdvantages of CTA over MRA include superior spatial resolution, rapid image acquisition, \ndecreased susceptibility to motion artifacts and artifacts from calcification as well as being \nbetter able to evaluate slow flow and tandem lesions. However, it can also overestimate \nhigh-grade stenosis. Limitations of CTA include radiation exposure to the patient, necessity \nof IV contrast, and risk of contrast allergy and contrast nephropathy. \n\nMRA and Dissection \nCraniocervical dissections can be spontaneous or traumatic. Patients with blunt head or \nneck trauma who meet Denver Screening criteria should be assessed for cerebrovascular \ninjury (although about 20% will not meet criteria). The criteria include: focal or lateralizing \nneurological deficits (not explained by head CT), infarct on head CT, face, basilar skull, or \ncervical spine fractures, cervical hematomas that are not expanding, glasgow coma score \nless than 8 without CT findings, massive epistaxis, cervical bruit or thrill. (20,51,52) Spontaneous \ndissection presents with headache, neck pain with neurological signs or symptoms. \n\nThere is often minor trauma or precipitating factor (e.g., exercise, neck manipulation). \nDissection is thought to occur due to weakness of the vessel wall, and there may be an \nunderlying connective tissue disorder. Dissection of the extracranial vessels can extend \nintracranially and/or lead to thrombus, which can migrate into the intracranial circulation \ncausing ischemia. Therefore, MRA of the head and neck is warranted. (21,53,54) \n\nMRA and Recent Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack \n\u25cf When revascularization therapy is not indicated or available in patients with an \n\nischemic stroke or TIA, the focus of the work-up is on secondary prevention. Both \nstroke and TIA should have an evaluation for high-risk modifiable factors such as \ncarotid stenosis atrial fibrillation as the cause of ischemic symptoms (55). Diagnostic \nrecommendations include neuroimaging evaluation as soon as possible, preferably \nwith magnetic resonance imaging, including DWI; noninvasive imaging of the \nextracranial vessels should be performed, and noninvasive imaging of intracranial \nvessels is reasonable. (56) \n\n\u25cf Patients with a history of stroke and recent work-up with new signs or symptoms \nindicating progression or complications of the initial CVA should have repeat brain \nimaging as an initial study. Patients with remote or silent strokes discovered on \nimaging should be evaluated for high-risk modifiable risk factors based on the \nlocation and type of the presumed etiology of the brain injury.  \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 9 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 012-2 for Neck MRA_MRV \n\nAcronyms \nCTA: Computed tomography angiography \nCVA: Cerebrovascular accident \nFMD: Fibromuscular dysplasia \nIAC: Internal auditory canal \nIV: Intravenous \nMRA: Magnetic resonance angiography \nMRV: Magnetic resonance venography \nSCAD: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection \nTIA: Transient ischemic attack \nUS: Ultrasound \nVBI: Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester). \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds weight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Updated references \n\n\u25cf Updated background section \n\u25cf Updated combination section \n\u25cf Clarified \n\n\u25cb Frequency of screening in genetic syndromes \n\u25cf Added \n\n\u25cb Follow-up of known carotid or vertebral artery dissection \nwithin 3-6 months for evaluation of recanalization and/or to \nguide anticoagulation treatment (already in combo) \n\n\u25cb Horner\u2019s syndrome, non-central (miosis, ptosis, and \nanhidrosis) - also in combo section  \n\n\u25cb Genetic syndromes and rare disease section \n\u25cb Giant cell arteritis with suspected intracranial and \n\nextracranial involvement (combos) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 10 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 012-2 for Neck MRA_MRV \n\nDate Summary \n\u25cb Large vessel vasculitis (Giant cell or Takayasu arteritis) \n\nwith suspected intracranial and extracranial involvement \n(combos) \n\n\u25cf Deleted \n\u25cb Aneurysm screening section  \n\u25cb MRI Brain with IAC/MRA Head/MRA Neck section  \n\nMay 2023 \u25cf Updated references \n\u25cf Follow-up of known carotid or vertebral artery dissection \n\nwithin 3-6 months for evaluation of recanalization and/or to \nguide anticoagulation treatment (Combo Neck/Brain MRA) \n\n\u25cf Section on further evaluation of indeterminate or questionable \nfindings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

001 for Brain MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nSpecial Note \nBrain MR/MRA are not approvable simultaneously unless they meet the criteria described \nbelow in the Indications for Brain MR/Brain MRA combination studies section. If there is a \ncombination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the same time or \nsequentially (within the past 3 months) the results of the prior study should be: \n\n\u25cf Inconclusive or show a need for additional or follow up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient. \n\n\u25cf (*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nPurpose \nBrain (head) MRI is the procedure of choice for most brain disorders. It provides clear \nimages of the brainstem and posterior brain, which are difficult to view on a CT scan. It is \nalso useful for the diagnosis of demyelinating disorders (such as multiple sclerosis (MS) that \ncause destruction of the myelin sheath of the nerve). The evaluation of blood flow and the \nflow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is possible with this non-invasive procedure. \n\nINDICATIONS \nHeadache (1,2) \nEvaluation of Headache \n\n\u25cf Chronic headache with a change in character/pattern (e.g., more frequent, increased \nseverity, or duration) (3) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\n\u25cf Cluster headaches or other trigeminal-autonomic cephalgias, i.e., paroxysmal \nhemicrania, hemicrania continua, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache \nattacks (SUNCT/SUNA) imaging is indicated once to eliminate secondary causes (3,4) \n\n\u25cf Acute headache, sudden onset: \n\n\u25cb With a personal or family history (brother, sister, parent, or child) of brain \naneurysm or AVM (arteriovenous malformation) OR \n\n\u25cb < 48 hours of \u201cworst headache in my life\u201d or \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache (Sudden \nonset new headache reaching maximum intensity within 2-3 minutes, lasting \nmore than 5 minutes). \n\n\u25cb Prior history of stroke or intracranial bleed \n\n\u25cb Known coagulopathy or anticoagulation. \n\n\u25cf New onset of headache with any of the following (3,5,6): \n\n\u25cb Acute, new, or fluctuating neurologic deficits, such as sensory deficits, limb \nweakness, abnormal reflexes (pathological, asymmetric, hyperreflexia), speech \ndifficulties, visual loss, lack of coordination, or mental status changes or with \nsigns of increased intracranial pressure (papilledema).

CT is faster and more readily available than MRI and is often \nused in urgent clinical situations. Neurologic imaging is warranted in patients with headache \ndisorders along with abnormal neurologic examination results or predisposing factors for \nbrain pathology. Contrast-enhanced MRI is performed for evaluation of inflammatory, \ninfectious, neoplastic, and demyelinating conditions. \n\nHeadache timeframes and other characteristics \u2013 Headaches can be classified as acute, \nsubacute or chronic. Acute headaches are present from hours to days, subacute from days \nto weeks and chronic headaches for more than 3 months. Acute severe headaches are more \nlikely to be pathological (e.g., SAH, cerebral venous thrombosis) than non-acute (e.g., \nmigraine, tension-type). Headaches can also be categorized as new onset or \nchronic/recurrent. Non-acute new onset headaches do not require imaging unless there is a \nred flag as delineated above. Incidental findings lead to additional medical procedures and \nexpense that do not improve patient well-being. Primary headache syndromes, such as \nmigraine and tension headaches, are often episodic with persistent or progressive headache \nnot responding to treatment requiring further investigation (e.g., new daily persistent \nheadache). Imaging is indicated in chronic headaches if there is a change in the headache \nfrequency (number of headaches episodes/month), duration of each episode, severity of the \nheadaches or new characteristics, such as changing aura or associated symptoms. \n(1,2,3,4,220,221,222,223,224) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 27 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\nMigraine with aura (4,5,225) \u2013 The headache phase of a migraine is preceded and/or \naccompanied by transient neurological symptoms referred to as aura in at least a third of \nmigraine attacks. Migraine with typical aura consists of visual and/or sensory and/or \nspeech/language symptoms, but no motor, brainstem or retinal symptoms and is \ncharacterized by gradual development, duration of each symptom no longer than one hour, a \nmix of positive and negative features and complete reversibility. Atypical or complex aura \nincludes motor, brainstem, monocular visual disturbances, or ocular cranial nerve \ninvolvement (hemiplegic migraine, basilar migraine/brainstem aura, retinal migraine, \nophthalmoplegic migraine) and secondary causes need to be excluded. Additional features \nof an aura that raise concern for an underlying vascular etiology include late age of onset, \nshort duration, evolution of the focal symptoms, negative rather than positive visual \nphenomenon, and history of vascular risk factors. \n\nIndividuals presenting with a new migraine with aura (especially an atypical or complex aura) \ncan mimic a transient ischemic attack or an acute stroke. If there is a new neurologic deficit, \nimaging should be guided by concern for cerebrovascular disease, not that the individual has \na headache. (9,226) \n\nDrop Metastases \nDrop Metastases \u2013 Drop metastases are intradural extramedullary spinal metastases that \narise from intracranial lesions. Common examples of intracranial neoplasms that result in \ndrop metastases include pineal tumors, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, germinomas, \nprimitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), glioblastomas multiform, anaplastic \nastrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and less commonly choroid plexus neoplasms and \nteratomas. (209) \n\nPulsatile Tinnitus \nPulsatile tinnitus- has many etiologies, and the choice of study should be based on \naccompanying signs and symptoms. For general screening MRI brain with IAC/MRA brain \nand neck is approvable. If IIIH is suspected (typically with headache and vision changes in a \nyounger woman with a high BMI), MRI/MRV brain is indicated. If there is concern for \nvascular etiology, CTA or MRA brain/neck is indicated. If there is associated hearing loss \nand neurological signs/symptoms, MRI brain with IAC is indicated. If the temporal bone is \nsuspected to be involved and/or retrotympanic lesion seen on otoscopy, CT temporal \nbone/IAC is indicated. If there is concurrent concern for boney and a vascular issue, CTA of \nthe head and neck can be used to evaluate both. \n\nLeptomeningeal Carcinomatosis \nLeptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (210,227,228,229) \u2013 Leptomeningeal metastasis is an \nuncommon and typically late complication of cancer with poor prognosis and limited \ntreatment options. Diagnosis is often challenging with nonspecific presenting symptoms \nranging from headache and confusion to focal neurologic deficits such as cranial nerve \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 28 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\npalsies. Standard diagnostic evaluation involves a neurologic examination, MRI of the brain \nand spine with gadolinium, and cytologic evaluation of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). \nHematologic malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma), primary brain tumors as well as solid \nmalignancies can spread to the leptomeninges. The most common solid tumors giving rise to \nLM are breast cancer (12 - 35 %), small and non-small cell lung cancer (10-26 %), \nmelanoma (5 -25 %), gastrointestinal malignancies (4-14 %), and cancers of unknown \nprimary (1-7 %). \n\nBrain MRI/MRA \nCombination MRI/MRA of the Brain \u2013 This is one of the most misused combination studies \nand other than what is indicated above these examinations should be ordered in sequence, \nnot together. Vascular abnormalities can be visualized on the brain MRI. \n\nVertigo \nMRI and Vertigo \u2013 The most common causes of vertigo seen are benign paroxysmal \npositional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuronitis (VN) and Meniere\u2019s disease. These \nperipheral causes of vertigo are benign, and treatment involves reassurance and \nmanagement of symptoms. Central causes of vertigo, such as cerebrovascular accidents \n(CVAs), tumors and multiple sclerosis (MS), need to be considered if the individual presents \nwith associated neurological symptoms, such as weakness, diplopia, sensory changes, \nataxia, or confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging is appropriate in the evaluation of \nindividuals with vertigo who have neurologic signs and symptoms, progressive unilateral \nhearing loss or risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. MRI is more appropriate than CT for \ndiagnosing vertigo due to its superiority in visualizing the posterior portion of the brain, where \nmost central nervous system disease that causes vertigo is found. A full neurologic and \notologic evaluation including provocative maneuvers, vestibular function testing and \naudiogram can help evaluate vertigo of unclear etiology and differentiate between central \nand peripheral vertigo. \n\nMacrocephaly \nMRI for Macrocephaly \u2013 Consider ultrasound in infants with macrocephaly and a normal \nneurological examination, no evidence of increased ICP and an open anterior fontanelle. If \nhead US is normal, the infant should be monitored closely. (230) The anterior fontanelle \ngenerally closes between 10 and 24 months of age, with 3% closing between 5-9 months \nand 11% after 24 months. (231) \n\nAnosmia \nAnosmia \u2013 Nonstructural causes of anosmia include post-viral symptoms, medications \n(Amitriptyline, Enalapril, Nifedipine, Propranolol, Penicillamine, Sumatriptan, Cisplatin, \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 29 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\nTrifluoperazine, Propylthiouracil). These should be considered prior to advanced imaging to \nlook for a structural cause. \n\nAnosmia and dysgeusia have been reported as common early symptoms in individuals with \nCOVID-19, occurring in greater than 80 percent of individuals. For isolated anosmia, imaging \nis typically not needed once the diagnosis of COVID has been made given the high \nassociation. As such, COVID testing should be done prior to imaging. (232,233,234) \nMRI Orbits, Face, and Neck MRI rather than MRI Brain is the mainstay for directly imaging \nthe olfactory apparatus and sinonasal or anterior cranial fossa tumors that may impair or \ndirectly involve the olfactory apparatus. \n\nTemporal Arteritis \nGiant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammatory disorder that should be considered in individuals \nover the age of 50 with the following signs or symptoms: new headaches, acute onset of \nvisual disturbances (especially transient monocular visual loss), jaw claudication, \nconstitutional symptoms, tenderness over the temporal artery, and elevated ESR and/or \nCRP. A diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is highly associated. Extra- and \nintracranial cerebral vasculitis can also be seen but is rarer, and strokes are related to \nvasculitis of extracranial cerebral arteries causing vertebral or internal carotid arteries \nstenosis. Gold standard for diagnosis of GCA is temporal artery biopsy. Color Doppler \nultrasound (CDUS) can be used as a surrogate for temporal artery biopsy in some cases. \nHigh-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can visualize the temporal arteries when \nused with contrast. \n\nGalactorrhea and Hyperprolactinemia \nGalactorrhea and MRI \u2013 Isolated galactorrhea without elevated prolactin \n(normoprolactinemic) is usually due to breast pathology, i.e., breast feeding, trauma, ill-fitting \nundergarments. Consider mammogram, breast ultrasound, and serial dilution of the \nindividual\u2019s prolactin sample to correct for possible hook effect.

The most frequent presentations are isolated headache, intracranial \nhypertension syndrome (headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual obscurations, pulsatile \ntinnitus, CN VI palsy, papilledema), (237) seizures, focal neurological deficits, and \nencephalopathy. Risk factors are hypercoagulable states inducing genetic prothrombotic \nconditions, antiphospholipid syndrome and other acquired prothrombotic diseases (such as \ncancer), oral contraceptives, pregnancy, puerperium (6-weeks postpartum), infections, and \ntrauma. COVID-19 infection is associated with hypercoagulability, a thromboinflammatory \nresponse, and an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) (238,239). Since \nvenous thrombosis can cause SAH, infarctions, and hemorrhage, parenchymal imaging with \nMRI/CT is also appropriate (30,240,241). \n\nNon-aneurysmal Vascular Malformations \nNon-aneurysmal vascular malformations can be divided in low flow vascular malformations \nand high flow vascular malformations. Low flow vascular malformations include dural venous \nanomalies (DVA), cavernomas, and capillary telangiectasias. High flow vascular \nmalformations include AVM and dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF). For low flow \nmalformations, MRI is the study of choice. Limited medical literature is available to support \nvascular imagining (CTA or MRA). CTA plays a limited role in the assessment of cavernoma \nbut may be used to demonstrate a DVA. MRA is not usually helpful in the assessment of \ncavernoma, capillary telangiectasia, and DVA. Vascular imaging is indicated in high flow \nvascular malformations (242). \n\nThere is no evidence to support screening of first-degree relatives for AVMs (243). The risk of \nhaving an AVM may be higher than in the general population, but absolute risk is low. \n\nStroke/TIA \nMRI and recent stroke or transient ischemic attack \u2013 When revascularization therapy is \nnot indicated or available in patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA, the focus of the work-up \nis on secondary prevention. Both stroke and TIA should have an evaluation for high-risk \nmodifiable factors such as carotid stenosis atrial fibrillation as the cause of ischemic \nsymptoms (244). Diagnostic recommendations include neuroimaging evaluation as soon as \npossible, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging, including DWI; noninvasive imaging \nof the extracranial vessels should be performed, and noninvasive imaging of intracranial \nvessels is reasonable. (245) \n\nPatients with a history of stroke and recent work-up with new signs or symptoms indicating \nprogression or complications of the initial CVA should have repeat brain imaging as an initial \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 32 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\nstudy. Patients with remote or silent strokes discovered on imaging should be evaluated for \nhigh-risk modifiable risk factors based on the location and type of the presumed etiology of \nthe brain injury. \n\nTable 1: Gait and Brain Imaging \nTable 1: Gait and Brain Imaging (246,247,248,249,250,251) \n\nGait Characteristic Work up/Imaging \n\nHemiparetic Spastic unilateral, circumduction Brain and/or, Cervical spine imaging \nbased on associated symptoms \n\nDiplegic Spastic bilateral, circumduction Brain, Cervical and Thoracic Spine \nimaging \n\nMyelopathic Wide based, stiff, unsteady Cervical and/or Thoracic spine MRI \nbased on associated symptoms \n\nAtaxic Broad based, clumsy, staggering, \nlack of coordination, usually also with \nlimb ataxia \n\nBrain imaging \n\n  \n\nApraxic Magnetic, shuffling, difficulty initiating Brain imaging \n\nParkinsonian  Stooped, small steps, rigid, turning \nen bloc, decreased arm swing \n\nBrain Imaging \n\nChoreiform Irregular, jerky, involuntary \nmovements  \n\nMedication review, consider brain \nimaging as per movement disorder \nBrain MR guidelines \n\nSensory \nataxic   \n\nCautious, stomping, worsening \nwithout visual input (i.e., + Romberg) \n\nEMG, blood work, consider spinal \n(cervical or thoracic cord imaging) \nimaging based on EMG \n\nNeurogenic Steppage, dragging of toes EMG, if there is foot drop, Lumbar \nspine MRI \n\nPelvis MR appropriate evidence of \nplexopathy \n\nVestibular Insecure, veer to one side, worse \nwhen eyes closed, vertigo \n\nConsider Brain/IAC MRI as per GL \n\nNon-neurological causes of gait dysfunction include pain (antalgic), side effects of drugs \n(analgesic, antihistamines, benzos, psych meds, antihypertensives), visual loss, hearing \nimpairment, orthopedic disorders, rheumatologic disorders, psychogenic, and \ncardiorespiratory problems (orthostasis) (247,249,250,251). \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 33 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\nNeurological Deficits \nExamples of abnormal reflexes related to upper motor neuron lesion/central pathology \ninclude hyperreflexia, clonus, Hoffman sign and Babinski, snout, palmar grasp, and rooting \nreflexes. \n\nVisual loss has many possible etiologies, and MRI is only indicated in suspected \nneurological causes of visual loss based on history and exam. Visual field defects, such as \nbitemporal hemianopsia, homonymous hemianopsia, or quadranopsia, require imaging as \nwell as does suspected optic nerve pathology. Subjective symptoms such as blurred vision \nor double vision with no clear correlate on neurological examination requires a \ncomprehensive eye evaluation to exclude more common causes, such as cataracts, \nrefractive errors, retinopathy, glaucoma, or macular degeneration. Transient visual loss with \nhistory consistent with TIA but normal exam at time of examination also should be imaged. \nPositive visual phenomena, such as photopsias or scintillations that march across the visual \nfield, suggest migraine whereas negative phenomenon, such as shaded or blurred, is more \ncharacteristic of ischemia. \n\nDefinitions \nMMSE \u2013 The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a tool that can be used to assess \nmental status systematically and thoroughly. It is an 11-question measure that tests five \nareas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and \nlanguage. The MMSE has been the most commonly used measure of cognitive function in \ndementia research, but researchers have recognized that it is relatively insensitive and \nvariable in mildly impaired individuals. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is \nindicative of cognitive impairment. The MMSE takes only 5-10 minutes to administer and is, \ntherefore, practical to use repeatedly and routinely. \n\nMoCA \u2013 The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed as a rapid screening \ninstrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention \nand concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, \nconceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. MoCA differs from the MMSE mainly by \nincluding tests of executive function and abstraction, and by putting less weight on \norientation to time and place. Ten of the MMSE's 30 points are scored solely on the time-\nplace orientation test, whereas the MoCA assigns it a maximum of six points. The MoCA \nalso puts more weight on recall and attention-calculation performance, while de-emphasizing \nlanguage skill. Time to administer the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible \nscore is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal. \n\nMRI and developmental delay \u2013 Significant developmental delay is defined as significant \ndelay (more than two standard deviations below the mean) in one or more developmental \ndomains: gross/fine motor, speech/language, cognition, social/personal, and activities of \ndaily living. Isolated delay in social/language development is characteristic of autism \nspectrum disorders or hearing loss. Isolated delay in motor development is characteristic of \ncerebral palsy (a static encephalopathy) or myopathy. Global developmental delay (GDD) is \na subset of developmental delay defined as significant delay (by at least 2 SD\u2019s) in two or \nmore developmental categories. Note that the term \u201cGDD\u201d is usually reserved for children <5 \nyears old, whereas in older children >5 years, disability is quantifiable with IQ testing. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 34 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\nTrigeminal Neuralgia (TN) \u2013 According to the International Headache Society, TN is \ndefined as \u201ca disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral brief electric shock-like pain, \nabrupt in onset and termination, limited to the distribution of one or more divisions of the \ntrigeminal nerve and triggered by innocuous stimuli.\u201d (4). Atypical features include bilateral, \nhearing loss, dizziness/vertigo, visual changes, sensory loss, numbness, pain > 2min, pain \noutside trigeminal nerve distribution and progression (121). \n\nOccipital Neuralgia \u2013 According to the International Headache Society, occipital neuralgia \nis defined \u201cUnilateral or bilateral paroxysmal, shooting or stabbing pain in the posterior part \nof the scalp, in the distribution(s) of the greater, lesser and/or third occipital nerves, \nsometimes accompanied by diminished sensation or dysesthesia in the affected area and \ncommonly associated with tenderness over the involved nerve(s). Pain is eased temporarily \nby local anesthetic block of the affected nerve(s). Occipital neuralgia must be distinguished \nfrom occipital referral of pain arising from the atlantoaxial or upper zygapophyseal joints or \nfrom tender trigger points in neck muscles or their insertions.\u201d (121) \n\nLow risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) formerly apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE) requires all the following: \n\n\u25cf Age > 60 days \n\n\u25cf Gestational age \u2265 32 weeks or older and corrected gestational age > 45 weeks \n\n\u25cf First brief event \n\n\u25cf Event lasting < 1 minute \n\n\u25cf No CPR required by the trained medical provider \n\n\u25cf No concerning historical features or physical examination findings. \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 Changes \n\n\u25cf Updated references \n\u25cf Updated background section \n\u25cf Updated combination section \n\u25cf Added \n\n\u25cb Genetic syndromes and rare disease section- reorganized \nindications \n\n\u25cb Note: Vessel wall MRI (ordered as Brain MRI) can also be \nperformed in the evaluation of vasculitides \n\n\u25cb PML suspected or known to the infectious or inflammatory \ndisease section. \n\n\u25cb And updated Brain MRI for Known Cancer sections (initial \nstaging, restaging and surveillance) \n\n\u25cb Vertigo with progressive unilateral hearing loss or tinnitus \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 35 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\n\u25cb Horner\u2019s syndrome with symptoms localizing the lesion to \nthe central nervous system (Brain/Cervical MRI Combo) \n\n\u25cb Known Moyamoya disease or eversible cerebral \nvasoconstriction with any new or changing neurological \nsigns or symptoms (also to (Brain MRA /MRI combo) \n\n\u25cb Suspected secondary CNS vasculitis based on \nneurological signs or symptoms in the setting of an \nunderlying systemic disease with abnormal inflammatory \nmarkers or autoimmune antibodies (Brain MRA /MRI \ncombo) \n\n\u25cb Suspected primary CNS vasculitis based on neurological \nsigns and symptoms with completed \ninfectious/inflammatory lab work-up ((Brain MRA /MRI \ncombo)) \n\n\u25cb Giant cell arteritis with suspected intracranial and \nextracranial involvement (Brain MRA /Neck/ Brain MRI \ncombo)) \n\n\u25cf Clarified \n\u25a0 Updated pediatric seizure section. \n\u25a0 Treatment of Alzheimer's disease with anti-amyloid-\u03b2 \n\nmonoclonal antibodies - baseline and surveillance \nimaging as per FDA labeling \n\n\u25cf Deleted \n\u25cb Aduhelm monitoring \n\u25cb MRI Brain with IAC/MRA Head/MRA Neck section \n\nMay 2023 \u25cf Updated and reformatted references \n\u25cf Updated background section \n\u25cf Added: \n\u25cf Indeterminate imaging section \n\u25cf Follow up of known Rathke cleft cyst \n\n\u25cb If no symptoms, MRI at 1/3/5 years to stability \n\u25cb With new neurological symptoms or atypical imaging \n\nfeatures \n\u25cb Post treatment, yearly for 5 years \n\n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of indeterminate \nfindings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf Clarified: \n\u25cf Abnormal reflexes (pathological, asymmetric, hyperreflexia) \n\u25cf New onset headache - Related to activity or event (sexual \n\nactivity, exertion, Valsalva, position), new or progressively \nworsening \n\n\u25cf Post concussive syndrome if persistent or disabling symptoms \nand MRI has not been performed \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 36 of 51 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 001 for Brain MRI \n\n\u25cf Screening for silent cerebral infarcts in early school age \nchildren and adults with HbSS sickle cell disease or HbS\u03b20 \nthalassemia \n\n\u25cf Cushing syndrome suspected (high ACTH (>5) with cortisol \nsuppression on low or high dose dexamethasone suppression \ntest) \n\n\u25cf Elevated prolactin after evaluation for another cause - \nneuroendocrine signs or symptoms (i.e., headache, \ngalactorrhea, abnormal menses, infertility, or bitemporal \nhemianopsia) and/or abnormal pituitary hormones (low \ntestosterone /estrogen/ \n\n\u25cf progesterone AND low or normal LH/FSH) \n\u25cf Total testosterone levels persistently borderline around the \n\nlower limits of normal range (200-400 ng/dL) with low or \nnormal LH/FSH;

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nfMRI \nFunctional MRI (fMRI) of the brain is a non-invasive imaging technique, to image the brain \nactivity of a patient prior to undergoing brain surgery for tumors or epilepsy. fMRI images \ncapture blood oxygen levels in parts of the brain that are responsible for perception, \ncognition, and movement allowing neurosurgeons to operate with less possibility of harming \nareas that are critical to the patient\u2019s quality of life. fMR is primarily used for presurgical \nplanning, operative risk assessment and therapeutic follow-up. \n\nSee Legislative Language section for legislation for the State of Washington. \n\nINDICATIONS FOR FUNCTIONAL BRAIN MRI (1,2) \nPre-Operative/Procedural Evaluation (1) \nfMRI may have a significant role in the mapping of a lesion in relation to eloquent cortex (i.e., \nlanguage, motor, sensory and visual centers) to determine the appropriateness of surgical \nintervention in the following: \n\n\u25cf Focal brain lesion (i.e., tumor or vascular malformation) for presurgical planning (3,4,5,6) \n\n\u25cf Pre-operative evaluation for epilepsy surgery (7,8) \n\n\u25cf Brain tumor for radiation treatment planning (9,10) \n\nPost-Operative/Procedural Evaluation \nTherapeutic follow-up: A documented medical reason must clearly explain the medical \nnecessity for follow up (i.e., evaluation of post-treatment eloquent cortex). \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 3 of 8 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 013 for Functional Brain MRI \n\nLEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE \nState of Washington (11) \nWSHCA 20150116A \nNumber and Coverage Topic: \n20150116A \u2013 Functional Neuroimaging for Primary Degenerative Dementia or Mild \nCognitive Impairment* \nHTCC Coverage Determination: \nFunctional neuroimaging for primary degenerative dementia or mild cognitive impairment is \nnot covered. \n\nHTCC Reimbursement Determination: \n     Limitations of Coverage: N/A \n\n     Non-covered Indicators: \nFunctional imaging technologies including: fludeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission \nTomography (PET), (11)C-dihydrotetrabenazine (C-DTBZ) PET, Single Photon Emission \nComputed Tomography (SPECT), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) for the \ndiagnosis of primary degenerative dementia or mild cognitive impairment. \n\n* Beta-amyloid PET imaging is outside the scope of this coverage determination. \n\nCODING AND STANDARDS \nCoding \nCPT Codes \n70554, 70555 \n\nApplicable Lines of Business \n\u2612 CHIP (Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) \n\u2612 Commercial \n\u2612 Exchange/Marketplace \n\u2612 Medicaid \n\u2610 Medicare Advantage \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 8 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 013 for Functional Brain MRI \n\nBACKGROUND \nTask vs. Resting State fMRI \nDuring resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), unlike task-based functional MRI, the individual is not \nrequired (12,13,14) to perform any specific task. This is beneficial for patients who have difficulty \nperforming tasks, such as pediatric and certain neurologic or psychiatric patients. This \ntechnique has been well-utilized in research, and its clinical use is increasing considerably, \nespecially in presurgical planning (e.g., mapping epileptic foci) and neuropsychiatric \ndiseases. \n\nFor the above indications, non-tasked based fMRI such as resting state fMRI can also be \nperformed. \n\nfMRI as an Alternative to Invasive Wada Test and Direct \nElectrical Stimulation \nfMRI is considered an alternative to the Wada test and direct electrical stimulation as it is a \nnon-invasive method for location of vital brain areas. The Wada test is used for the pre-\noperative evaluations of patients with brain tumors and seizures to determine which side of \nthe brain is responsible for vital cognitive functions (e.g., speech and memory) and can \nassess the surgical risk of damaging vital areas of the brain. The Wada test is invasive, \ninvolving an angiography procedure to guide a catheter to the internal carotid where a \nbarbiturate is injected, putting one hemisphere of the brain to sleep. Direct electrical \nstimulation mapping is invasive requiring the placement of electrodes in the brain. The \nelectrodes are used to stimulate multiple cortical sites in the planned area of resection to \nallow the surgeons to identify and mark which areas can be safely resected. (15,16) \n\nfMRI and Brain Tumors \nDue to its non-invasiveness, its relatively high spatial resolution, and its pre-operative \nresults, fMRI is used before surgery in the evaluation of patients with brain tumors. fMRI may \nhave a significant role in mapping lesions that are located in close proximity to vital areas of \nbrain function (language, sensory motor, and visual). It can determine the precise spatial \nrelationship between the lesion and adjacent functionally essential parenchyma, allowing \nremoval of as much pathological tissue as possible during resection of brain tumors without \ncompromising essential brain functions. fMRI provides an alternative to other invasive tests, \nsuch as the Wada test and direct electrical stimulation. (17) \n\nfMRI and Seizures \nBrain fMRI \nBrain surgery is often the treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy, especially patients \nwith a single seizure focus. fMRI can be used to image and localize abnormal brain function \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 8 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 013 for Functional Brain MRI \n\nin patients with seizures and help determine brain functions (language, sensory motor, and \nvisual) of areas bordering the lesion, resulting in better outcomes with less neurologic deficit. \n(18) \n\nfMRI is increasingly being used to evaluate candidates for surgical treatment of intractable \nepilepsy (Phase 1 evaluation) and can aid in surgical decision-making. It can 1) help to \nimprove functional outcome by enabling surgery that spares functional cortex, 2) guide \nsurgical intervention by revealing when reorganization of function has occurred, and 3) show \nwhen abnormal cortex is also functionally active, and hence that surgery may not be the best \noption. (19,20) \n\nContraindication and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester). \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \n July 2024 \u25cf Updated background and references  \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and preferred studies section added to the \nbackground \n\n\u25cf Added legislative language for Washington \nMay 2023 \u25cf Updated background and references \n\n\u25cf Added - to determine the appropriateness of surgical \nintervention \n\n\u25cf Background section regarding non-task-based fMRI \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 6 of 8 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 013 for Functional Brain MRI \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

Guideline 020 for Chest (Thorax) CT \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nChest Computed Tomography (CT) generates images of the organs and structures in the \nchest (thorax) with the use of radiation.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR CHEST CT \nScreening for Lung Cancer \n\n\u25cf The use of low-dose, non-contrast spiral (helical) multi-detector CT imaging as an \nannual screening technique for lung cancer is considered medically necessary ONLY \nwhen used to screen for lung cancer for certain high-risk asymptomatic individuals \nwhen ALL of the following criteria are met:(1) \n\n\u25cb Individual is between 50-80 years of age*; AND  \n\n\u25cb There is at least a 20 pack-year history of cigarette** smoking \n\n*May approve for individuals over the age limit if the individual is a candidate for and willing \nto undergo curative treatment upon diagnosis \n\n** Only personal cigarette smoking history as above places an individual at high risk; \nsecondhand smoke exposure and other forms of smoking (such as pipe, cigar, marijuana, \nvaping) do NOT factor into current recommendations for LDCT Screening. \n\n\u25cf Screening should be discontinued once a person develops a health problem that \nlimits the willingness or ability to have curative intent treatment.

If CXR suggests a malignancy and/or source of fever, then \nChest CT would be approved. \n\nSuspected paraneoplastic syndromes with no established \ncancer diagnosis: laboratory evaluation and imaging \nThe laboratory evaluation for paraneoplastic syndrome is complex. If the appropriate lab test \nresults are suspicious for malignancy, imaging is indicated. \n\nFor SIADH (hyponatremia + increased urine osmolality), there is a high association with \nsmall cell lung cancer, therefore imaging typically starts with chest CT. If other symptoms \nsuggest a different diagnosis other than small cell lung cancer, different imaging studies may \nbe reasonable. \n\nFor hypercalcemia (high serum calcium, low-normal PTH, high PTHrP) it is reasonable to \nstart with bone imaging followed by a more directed evaluation such as mammogram, chest, \nabdomen and pelvis imaging as appropriate. \n\nFor Cushing syndrome (hypokalemia, normal-high midnight serum ACTH NOT suppressed \nwith dexamethasone) abdominal and chest imaging is reasonable. If dexamethasone \nsuppression test DOES suppress ACTH, pituitary MRI is reasonable. \n\nFor hypoglycemia, labs drawn during a period of hypoglycemia (glucose < 55, typically a 72 \nhour fast) (insulin level, C-peptide and IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio) should be done to evaluate for an \ninsulinoma. An elevated insulin level, elevated C-peptide and/or normal IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio \nwarrant CT or MRI abdomen to look for insulinoma. A low insulin, low C-peptide and/or \nelevated IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio warrant chest and abdominal imaging. \n\nWhen a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome is suspected, nuclear and cytoplasmic antibody \npanels are often ordered to further identify specific tumor types. Results are needed prior to \nimaging. Because these tests are highly specific, if an antibody highly associated with a \nspecific cancer is positive, then further imaging for that cancer is reasonable. For example, \nanti-Hu has a high association with SCLC and chest CT would be reasonable. Anti-MA2 has \na high association with testicular cancer and testicular ultrasound would be a reasonable \nnext step. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 17 of 23 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 020 for Chest (Thorax) CT \n\nTable 1: Lung-RADS Assessment Categories \n*This table is reproduced without alteration or edit in accordance with provisions in a \nCreative Commons License.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nLow Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) generates images of the lungs (chest) and is \nused to screen for and detect lung cancer in high-risk patients and/or patients with a history \nof lung cancer. This study uses low doses of radiation (100-120 kVp and 40-60 mAs) and is \nprimarily used to evaluate the lung parenchyma. When evaluation of structures such as \nlymph nodes or the mediastinum is needed, a standard dose CT with IV contrast may be \nmore appropriate. (1) \n\nINDICATIONS \nFor Annual Screening \nThe use of low-dose, non-contrast spiral (helical) multi-detector CT imaging as a screening \ntechnique for lung cancer is considered medically necessary ONLY when used to screen \nfor lung cancer for certain high-risk, asymptomatic individuals, i.e., no acute lung-related \nsymptoms, when ALL of the following criteria are met  \n\nScreening should be discontinued once a person develops a health problem that limits the \nwillingness or ability to have curative intent treatment.

022-1 for Chest CTA \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) generates images of the blood vessels (arteries \nand/or veins) in the chest that can be evaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, \nembolism, dissection and/or aneurysms. Chest CTA (non-coronary) is used to evaluate the \narteries outside the heart in the chest (thorax). CTA uses ionizing radiation and requires the \nadministration of iodinated contrast agent, which is a potential hazard in patients with \nimpaired renal function.  \n\nNOTE: Authorization for CT Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging. The term \nangiography refers to both arteriography and venography. \n\nINDICATIONS \nKnown or Suspected Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (1,2,3,4,5,6) \n\n\u25cf Suspected pulmonary embolism: \n\n\u25cb High risk for PE based on shock or hypotension, OR a validated pre-test high \nprobability score (such as Well\u2019s >6, Modified Geneva score >11), \n\n\u25a0 (D-dimer is NOT needed for high-risk patients; can approve high-risk even \nwith normal D dimer) \n\n\u25cb Intermediate and Low risk require elevated D-dimer \n\n\u25cf Follow up of known pulmonary embolism with either symptoms (such as dyspnea, \nfatigue, lightheadedness and/or edema) that recur OR are persistent at 3 months \nfollowing initial diagnosis (Follow-up imaging in asymptomatic patients to determine if \nembolus has resolved or to determine cessation of anticoagulation is not indicated as \nimaging changes may persist)) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 15 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 022-1 for Chest CTA \n\nThoracic

Guideline 021 for Chest (Thorax) MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nChest Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) generates images of the organs and structures \nwithin the chest (thorax) without the use of ionizing radiation. Chest MRI images are affected \nby motion artifact from respiration, thus is generally not used for evaluation of the lung \nparenchyma. \n\nINDICATIONS FOR CHEST MRI \nChest Wall Pain \n\nNon-traumatic chest wall pain after initial imaging (such as x-ray) has been performed and \nChest CT is contraindicated or cannot be performed \n\n\u25cf History of known or suspected cancer (no prior x-ray needed) (1) \n\n\u25cf Signs and symptoms of infection with concern for chest wall involvement, such as: \nfever, elevated inflammatory markers, known infection at other sites (1) \n\n\u25cf Suspected chest wall injuries (including musculotendinous, costochondral cartilage, \nsternoclavicular joint, and manubriosternal joint injuries) after non-diagnostic or \nindeterminate prior imaging (such as x-ray or ultrasound) when imaging will \npotentially alter management \n\nBrachial Plexopathy (2,3) \n\u25cf Traumatic Brachial Plexopathy: If mechanism of injury is highly suspicious for \n\nbrachial plexopathy (such as mid-clavicular fracture, shoulder dislocation, contact \ninjury to the neck (burner or stinger syndrome) or penetrating injury) (4) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 021 for Chest (Thorax) MRI \n\n\u25cf Non-traumatic Brachial Plexopathy (including neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome) \nwhen Electromyography/Nerve Conduction Velocity (EMG/NCV) studies are \nsuggestive of brachial plexopathy \n\nNOTE: Either Neck MRI, Shoulder MRI or Chest MRI may be appropriate depending on the \nlocation of the injury/plexopathy.

Chest MRA \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) generates images of the blood vessels (arteries \nand/or veins) in the chest that can be evaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or \naneurysms without use of ionizing radiation. Chest MRA (non-coronary) is used to evaluate \nthe blood vessels outside the heart in the chest (thorax).  \n\nNOTE: Authorization for MR Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging. The term \nangiography refers to both arteriography and venography. \n\nINDICATIONS \nSuspected Pulmonary Embolism \n\n\u25cf Suspected pulmonary embolism when CTA is contraindicated or cannot be\nperformed:\n\n\u25cb High risk for PE based on shock or hypotension, OR a validated pre-test high\nprobability score (such as Well\u2019s > 6, Modified Geneva score > 11),\n\n\u25a0 (D-dimer is NOT needed for high-risk patients; can approve high-risk even\nwith normal D dimer)\n\n\u25cb Intermediate and Low risk require elevated D-dimer\n\n\u25cf Follow up of known pulmonary embolism when CTA is contraindicated or cannot be\nperformed AND either symptoms (such as dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness and/or\nedema) that recur OR are persistent at 3 months following initial diagnosis. (Follow-\nup imaging in asymptomatic patients to determine if embolus has resolved or to\ndetermine cessation of anticoagulation is not indicated as imaging changes may\npersist)\n\n\n\nPage 4 of 13

Guideline 041 for Cervical Spine CT \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nComputed tomography (CT) is performed for the evaluation of the cervical spine. CT may be \nused as the primary imaging modality, or it may complement other modalities. Primary \nindications for CT include conditions, e.g., traumatic, neoplastic, and infectious. CT is often \nused to study the cervical spine for conditions such as degenerative disc disease when MRI \nis contraindicated. CT provides excellent depiction of bone detail and is used in the \nevaluation of known fractures of the cervical spine and for evaluation of postoperative \npatients. \n\nSpecial Note \n+If there is a combination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the \nsame time or sequentially (within the past 3 months): \n\n\u25cf The results of the prior study should be inconclusive or show a need for inconclusive \nor show a need for additional or follow-up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient. \n\n \n(*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR CERVICAL SPINE CT \nEvaluation of Neurologic Deficits (1,2) \n When Cervical Spine MRI is Contraindicated or Inappropriate \n\n\u25cf With any of the following new neurological deficits documented on physical exam \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 041 for Cervical Spine CT \n\n\u25cb Extremity muscular weakness (and not likely caused by plexopathy or peripheral \nneuropathy) \n\n\u25cb Pathologic (e.g., Babinski, Lhermitte's sign(3), Chaddock Sign(4), Hoffman\u2019s and \nother upper motor neuron signs); OR abnormal deep tendon reflexes (and not \nlikely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy) \n\n\u25cb Absent/decreased sensory changes along a particular cervical dermatome (nerve \ndistribution):  pin prick, touch, vibration, proprioception, or temperature (and not \nlikely caused by plexopathy or peripheral neuropathy) \n\n\u25cb Upper or lower extremity increase muscle tone/spasticity \n\n\u25cb New onset bowel or bladder dysfunction (e.g., retention or incontinence)\u2014not \nrelated to an inherent bowel or bladder process \n\n\u25cb Gait abnormalities (see Table 1 below for more details) \n\n\u25cf Suspected cord compression with any neurological deficits as listed above \n\nEvaluation of Neck Pain  (5,6) \nWith any of the Following when Cervical Spine MRI is Contraindicated \n\n\u25cf With new or worsening objective neurologic deficits on exam, as above \n\n\u25cf Failure of conservative treatment* for a minimum of six (6) weeks within the last six \n(6) months; \n\n\u25cf NOTE - Failure of conservative treatment is defined as one of the following: \n\n\u25cb Lack of meaningful improvement after a full course of treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Progression or worsening of symptoms during treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Documentation of a medical reason the member is unable to participate in \ntreatment \n\n\u25cb Closure of medical or therapy offices, patient inconvenience, or noncompliance \nwithout explanation does not constitute \u201cinability to complete\u201d treatment. \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment* \n\n\u25cf With an abnormal electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study (if performed) \nindicating a cervical radiculopathy.

Guideline 043 for Thoracic Spine CT \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nComputed tomography is used for the evaluation, assessment of severity, and follow-up of \ndiseases of the spine. Its use in the thoracic spine is limited, however, due to the lack of \nepidural fat in this part of the body. CT myelography improves the contrast severity of CT, \nbut it is also invasive. CT may be used for conditions, e.g., degenerative changes, infection, \nand immune suppression, when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is contraindicated. It \nmay also be used in the evaluation of tumors, cancer, or metastasis in the thoracic spine, \nand it may be used for preoperative and post-surgical evaluations. CT obtains images from \ndifferent angles and uses computer processing to show a cross-section of body tissues and \norgans. CT is fast and is often performed in acute settings. It provides good visualization of \ncortical bone. \n\nSpecial Note \n+If there is a combination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the same \ntime or sequentially (within the past 3 months): \n\n\u25cf The results of the prior study should be inconclusive or show a need for additional or \nfollow-up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient (the entire spinal cord \nand/or autonomic postganglionic chain must be assessed). \n\n \n(*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 18 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 043 for Thoracic Spine CT \n\nINDICATIONS FOR THORACIC SPINE CT \nEvaluation of Neurologic Deficits  (1,2) \nWhen Thoracic Spine MRI is Contraindicated or Inappropriate \n\n\u25cf With any of the following new neurological deficits documented on physical exam \n\n\u25cb Extremity muscular weakness (and not likely caused by plexopathy or peripheral \nneuropathy)(3) \n\n\u25cb Pathologic (e.g., Babinski, Lhermitte's sign(4), Chaddock Sign(5), Hoffman\u2019s and \nother upper motor neuron signs); OR abnormal deep tendon reflexes (and not \nlikely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy)  \n\n\u25cb Absent/decreased sensory changes along a particular thoracic dermatome (nerve \ndistribution): pin prick, touch, vibration, proprioception, or temperature weakness \n(and not likely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy) \n\n\u25cb Upper or lower extremity increase muscle tone/spasticity and likely localized to \nthe thoracic spinal cord  \n\n\u25cb New onset bowel or bladder dysfunction (e.g., retention or incontinence)\u2014not \nrelated to an inherent bowel or bladder process \n\n\u25cb Gait abnormalities (see Table 1 below for more details) \n\n\u25cf Suspected cord compression with any neurological deficits as listed above \n\nEvaluation of Back Pain  (6) \nWith any of the following when Thoracic Spine MRI is Contraindicated \n\n\u25cf With new or worsening objective neurologic deficits on exam, as above \n\n\u25cf Failure of conservative treatment* for a minimum of six (6) weeks within the last six \n(6) months; \n\nNOTE - Failure of conservative treatment is defined as one of the following: \n\n\u25cb Lack of meaningful improvement after a full course of treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Progression or worsening of symptoms during treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Documentation of a medical reason the member is unable to participate in \ntreatment \n\nClosure of medical or therapy offices, patient inconvenience, or noncompliance without \nexplanation does not constitute \u201cinability to complete\u201d treatment. \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment* \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 18 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 043 for Thoracic Spine CT \n\n\u25cf With an abnormal electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study (if performed) \nindicating a thoracic radiculopathy.

Its use in the thoracic spine is limited, however, due to the lack of \nepidural fat in this part of the body. CT myelography improves the contrast severity of CT, but it \nis also invasive. CT may be used for conditions, e.g., degenerative changes, infection, and \nimmune suppression, when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is contraindicated. It may also \nbe used in the evaluation of tumors, cancer, or metastasis in the thoracic spine, and it may be \nused for preoperative and post-surgical evaluations. CT obtains images from different angles \nand uses computer processing to show a cross-section of body tissues and organs. CT is fast and \nis often performed in acute settings. It provides good visualization of cortical bone.  \n\nOVERVIEW \n\n*Conservative Treatment\nNon-operative conservative treatment should include a multimodality approach consisting of at\nleast one (1) active and one (1) inactive component targeting the affected region.\n\nActive Modalities \n\n\u2022 Physical therapy\n\n\u2022 Physician-supervised home exercise program**\n\n\u2022 Chiropractic care\n\nInactive Modalities \n\n\u2022 Medications (e.g., NSAIDs, steroids, analgesics)\n\n\u2022 Injections (e.g., epidural injection, selective nerve root block)\n\n\u2022 Medical Devices (e.g., TENS unit, bracing)\n\n**Home Exercise Program  (HEP) \nThe following two elements are required to meet conservative therapy guidelines for HEP:9, 14 \n\n\u2022 Documentation of an exercise prescription/plan provided by a physician, physical\ntherapist, or chiropractor; AND\n\n\n\n\u2022 Follow-up documentation regarding completion of HEP after the required 6-week\ntimeframe  or inability to complete HEP due to a documented medical reason (e.g.,\nincreased pain or inability to physically perform exercises).\n\nTable 1: Gait and spine imaging59-64 \n\nGait Characteristic Work up/Imaging \n\nHemiparetic Spastic unilateral, circumduction Brain and/or, Cervical spine imaging \nbased on associated symptoms \n\nDiplegic Spastic bilateral, circumduction Brain, Cervical and Thoracic Spine \nimaging \n\nMyelopathic Wide based, stiff, unsteady Cervical and/or Thoracic spine MRI \nbased on associated symptoms \n\nCerebellar ataxic Broad based, clumsy, staggering, \nlack of coordination, usually also \nwith limb ataxia  \n\nBrain imaging see Brain MRI Guideline \n\nApraxic Magnetic, shuffling, difficulty \ninitiating \n\nBrain imaging see Brain MRI Guideline \n\nParkinsonian Stooped, small steps, rigid, \nturning en bloc, decreased arm \nswing \n\nBrain Imaging see Brain MRI Guideline \n\nChoreiform Irregular, jerky, involuntary \nmovements \n\nMedication review, consider brain \nimaging as per movement disorder \nBrain MR guidelines \n\nSensory ataxic Cautious, stomping, worsening \nwithout visual input (ie + \nRomberg) \n\nEMG, blood work, consider spinal \n(cervical or thoracic cord imaging) \nimaging based on EMG \n\nNeurogenic Steppage, dragging of toes \u2022 EMG initial testing;\n\n\u2022 BUT if there is a foot drop, lumbar\nspine MRI is appropriate without\nEMG\n\n\u2022 Pelvis MR if there is evidence of\nplexopathy\n\nVestibular Insecure, veer to one side, worse \nwhen eyes closed, vertigo \n\nConsider Brain/IAC MRI see Brain MRI \nGuideline \n\nMyelopathy \u2013 Symptom severity varies, and a high index of suspicion is essential for making the \nproper diagnosis in early cases. Symptoms of pain and radiculopathy may not be present.  The \nnatural history of myelopathy is characterized by neurological deterioration. The most \nfrequently encountered symptom is gait abnormality (86%), followed by increased muscular \nreflexes (79.1%), pathological reflexes (65.1%), paresthesia of upper limb (69.8%), and pain \n(67.4%).65 \n\nPage 9 of 18 \nThoracic Spine CT \n\n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc.\n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\nPage 10 of 18 \nThoracic Spine CT \n\n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc. \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\nCT Myelogram \u2013 Myelography is the instillation of intrathecal contrast media under \nfluoroscopy. Patients are then imaged with CT to evaluate for spinal canal pathology. Although \nthis technique has diminished greatly due to the advent of MRI and its non-invasiveness and \nsuperior soft-tissue contrast, myelography is still a useful technique for conventional \nindications, such as spinal stenosis, when MRI is contraindicated, nondiagnostic or surgeon \npreference (see guidelines above), brachial plexus injury in neonates, radiation therapy \ntreatment planning, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.66 \n\nBack Pain with Cancer History \u2013 Bone is the third most common site of metastases after the \nliver and the lungs, and approximately two-thirds of all osseous metastases occur in the spine. \nApproximately 60\u201370% of patients with systemic cancer will have spinal \nmetastasis. Radiographic (x-ray) examination should be performed in cases of back pain when a \npatient has a cancer history, but without known active cancer or a tumor that tends to \nmetastasize to the spine.  This can make a diagnosis in many cases. This may occasionally allow \nfor selection of bone scan in lieu of MRI in some cases. When radiographs do not answer the \nclinical question, then MRI may be appropriate after a consideration of conservative care. \n\n\u201cNeoplasms causing VCF (vertebral compression fractures) include1) primary bone neoplasms, \nsuch as hemangioma (aggressive type) or giant cell tumors, and tumor-like conditions causing \nbony and cellular remodeling, such as aneurysmal bone cysts, or Paget\u2019s disease (osteitis \ndeformans); ; 2) primary malignant neoplasms including but not limited to multiple myeloma \nand lymphoma; and 3) metastatic neoplasms, including and not limited to, multiple myeloma \nand lymphoma, and metastatic neoplasms.\u201d28 \n\nMost common spine metastasis involving primary metastasis originate from the following \ntumors in descending order: breast (21%), lung (19%), prostate (7.5%), renal (5%), \ngastrointestinal (4.5%), and thyroid (2.5%). While all tumors can seed to the spine, the cancers \nmentioned above metastasize to the spinal column early in the disease process.37 \nDrop Metastases67 \u2013 Drop metastases are intradural extramedullary spinal metastases that \narise from intracranial lesions. Common examples of intracranial neoplasms that result in drop \nmetastases include pineal tumors, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, germinomas, primitive \nneuroectodermal tumors (PNET), glioblastomas multiform, anaplastic astrocytomas, \noligodendrogliomas and less commonly choroid plexus neoplasms and teratomas. \n\nLeptomeningeal Carcinomatosis68 \u2013 Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a complication of cancer \nin which cancerous cells spread to the membranes (meninges) that covers the brain and spinal \ncord. The most common solid tumors that involve the leptomeninges are breast, lung, \nmelanoma, gastrointestinal, and primary central nervous system tumors. \n\n\n\nPage 11 of 18 \nThoracic Spine CT \n\n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc. \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\nTable 2: CT and Cutaneous Stigmata69 \n\nRisk Stratification for Various Cutaneous Markers \n\nHigh Risk Intermediate Risk Low Risk \n\n\u2022 Hypertrichosis\n\u2022 Infantile\n\nhemangioma\n\u2022 Atretic meningocele\n\u2022 DST\n\u2022 Subcutaneous\n\nlipoma\n\u2022 Caudal appendage\n\u2022 Segmental\n\nhemangiomas in\nassociation with\nLUMBAR\u2021 syndrome\n\n\u2022 Capillary\nmalformations (also\nreferred to as NFS or\nsalmon patch when\npink and poorly\ndefined or PWS\nwhen darker red and\nwell-defined)\n\n\u2022 Coccygeal dimple\n\u2022 Light hair\n\u2022 Isolated caf\u00e9 au lait\n\nspots\n\u2022 Mongolian spots\n\u2022 Hypo- and\n\nhypermelanotic\nmacules or papules\n\n\u2022 Deviated or forked\ngluteal cleft\n\n\u2022 Nonmidline lesions\n\n\u2021LUMBAR, lower body hemangioma and other cutaneous defects, urogenital abnormalities, ulcerations, \n\nmyelopathy, bony defects, anorectal malformations, arterial anomalies, and renal anomalies. \n\n\n\nPage 12 of 18 \nThoracic Spine CT \n\n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc. \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\nPOLICY HISTORY \n\nDate Summary \n\nDec 2023 Conservative treatment language updated in body and background \n\nMay 2023 \u2022 Updated references\n\n\u2022 Updated background section\n\n\u2022 Clarified pathological reflexes\n\n\u2022 Added pseudoarthrosis to surgery section\n\u2022 Added \u201cFurther evaluation of indeterminate or questionable\n\nfindings on prior imaging\u201d:\n\n\u2022 Clarified cerebellar ataxia in gait table\n\n\u2022 Removed radicular pain and malaise from Isolated Back Pain in the\nPediatric population: Red flags.\n\n\u2022 Removed Additional Resources\n\n\u2022 General Information moved to beginning of guideline with added\nstatement on clinical indications not addressed in this guideline\n\n\u2022 Added statement regarding further evaluation of indeterminate\nfindings on prior imaging\n\nMarch 2022 Added \n\n\u2022 Combination request for overlapping body part statement\n\n\u2022 Clarified muscle weakness not related to plexopathy or peripheral\nneuropathy\n\n\u2022 Clarified bowel and bladder dysfunction \u2013 not related to an\ninherent bowel or bladder problem\n\n\u2022 Descriptions for tethered cord\n\n\u2022 Clarified CT myelogram section\n\n\u2022 Background section of Drop Metastases\n\n\u2022 Background section of Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis\n\n\u2022 Clarified toe walking in pediatric patient with myelopathy for\nthoracic spine\n\nRemoved \n\n\u2022 Removed from combination section syrinx and syringomyelia and\nadded subsection for cervical and thoracic spine section\n\n\u2022 Removed pediatric back pain from the total spine combination\nsection\n\nhttps://www.spine.org/Portals/0/Assets/Downloads/ResearchClinicalCare/Guidelines/CervicalRadiculopathy.pdf\nhttps://www.spine.org/Portals/0/Assets/Downloads/ResearchClinicalCare/Guidelines/CervicalRadiculopathy.pdf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519555/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556030/\nhttps://www.choosingwisely.org/clinician-lists/american-association-neurological-surgeons-imaging-for-nonspecific-acute-low-back-pain/\nhttps://www.choosingwisely.org/clinician-lists/american-association-neurological-surgeons-imaging-for-nonspecific-acute-low-back-pain/\nhttps://www.choosingwisely.org/clinician-lists/nass-emg-nerve-conduction-studies-to-determine-cause-of-spine-pain/\nhttps://www.choosingwisely.org/clinician-lists/nass-emg-nerve-conduction-studies-to-determine-cause-of-spine-pain/\nhttps://acsearch.acr.org/docs/3099011/Narrative/\n\n\nPage 13 of 18 \nThoracic Spine CT \n\n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc.  \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

Guideline 045 for Lumbar Spine CT \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nComputed tomography is used for the evaluation, assessment of severity, and follow-up of \ndiseases of the spine.  \n\nSpecial Note \n+If there is a combination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the same \ntime or sequentially (within the past 3 months):  \n\n\u25cf The results of the prior study should be inconclusive or show a need for additional or \nfollow up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient. \n\n \n(*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR LUMBAR SPINE CT \nEvaluation of Neurologic Deficits  \nWhen Lumbar Spine MRI is Contraindicated or Inappropriate \n \nWith any of the following new neurological deficits documented on physical exam \n\n\u25cf Extremity muscular weakness (and not likely caused by plexopathy or peripheral \nneuropathy)(1) \n\n\u25cf Pathologic or abnormal reflexes (and not likely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral \nneuropathy) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 18 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 045 for Lumbar Spine CT \n\n\u25cf Absent/decreased sensory changes along a particular lumbar dermatome (nerve \ndistribution): pin prick, touch, vibration, proprioception, or temperature weakness \n(and not likely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy) \n\n\u25cf Lower extremity increased muscle tone \n\n\u25cf New onset bowel or bladder dysfunction (e.g., retention or incontinence)\u2014not related \nto an inherent bowel or bladder process \n\n\u25cf Gait abnormalities (see Table 1 below for more details) \n\n\u25cf New onset foot drop (Not related to a peripheral nerve injury, e.g., peroneal nerve) \n\n\u25cf Cauda Equina Syndrome as evidence by severe back pain/sciatica along with one of \nthe defined symptoms (see Cauda Equina Syndrome section) \n\nEvaluation of Back Pain  (2) \nWith any of the following when Lumbar Spine MRI is Contraindicated \n\n\u25cf With new or worsening objective neurologic deficits on exam, as above \n\n\u25cf Failure of conservative treatment* for at minimum of six (6) weeks within the last six \n(6) months; \n\nNOTE - Failure of conservative treatment is defined as one of the following: \n\n\u25cb Lack of meaningful improvement after a full course of treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Progression or worsening of symptoms during treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Documentation of a medical reason the member is unable to participate in \ntreatment \n\nClosure of medical or therapy offices, patient inconvenience, or noncompliance without \nexplanation does not constitute \u201cinability to complete\u201d treatment. \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment* \n\n\u25cf With an abnormal electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study (if performed) \nindicating a lumbar radiculopathy. (EMG is not recommended to determine the cause \nof axial lumbar, thoracic, or cervical spine pain)(3) \n\n\u25cf Isolated back pain in pediatric population(4,5) (conservative care not required if red \nflags present).

Guideline 040 for Cervical Spine MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces high quality multiplanar images of organs and \nstructures within the body without radiation. It is the preferred modality for evaluating the \ninternal structure of the spinal cord, providing assessment of conditions such as \ndegenerative disc pathology, osteomyelitis, and discitis.  \n\nSpecial Note \n+If there is a combination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the \nsame time or sequentially (within the past 3 months): \n\n\u25cf The results of the prior study should be inconclusive or show a need for additional or \nfollow-up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient. \n\n(*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR CERVICAL SPINE MRI \nEvaluation of Neurologic Deficits (1,2) \n\n\u25cf With any of the following new neurological deficits documented on physical exam \n\n\u25cb Extremity muscular weakness (and not likely caused by plexopathy or peripheral \nneuropathy) \n\n\u25cb Pathologic (e.g., Babinski, Lhermitte's sign,(3) Chaddock Sign,(4) Hoffman\u2019s and \nother upper motor neuron signs); OR abnormal deep tendon reflexes (and not \nlikely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 22 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 040 for Cervical Spine MRI \n\n\u25cb Absent/decreased sensory changes along a particular cervical dermatome (nerve \ndistribution):  pin prick, touch, vibration, proprioception, or temperature (and not \nlikely caused by plexopathy or peripheral neuropathy) \n\n\u25cb Upper or lower extremity increase muscle tone/spasticity \n\n\u25cb New onset bowel or bladder dysfunction (e.g., retention or incontinence)\u2014not \nrelated to an inherent bowel or bladder process \n\n\u25cb Gait abnormalities (see Table 1 below for more details) \n\n\u25cf Suspected cord compression with any neurological deficits as listed above \n\nEvaluation of Neck Pain (5,6) \n\u25cf With new or worsening objective neurologic deficits on exam, as above \n\n\u25cf Failure of conservative treatment* for a minimum of six (6) weeks within the last six \n(6) months; \n\nNOTE - Failure of conservative treatment is defined as one of the following: \n\n\u25cb Lack of meaningful improvement after a full course of treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Progression or worsening of symptoms during treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Documentation of a medical reason the member is unable to participate in \ntreatment \n\nClosure of medical or therapy offices, patient inconvenience, or noncompliance without \nexplanation does not constitute \u201cinability to complete\u201d treatment. \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment* \n\n\u25cf With an abnormal electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study (if performed) \nindicating a cervical radiculopathy.

Guideline 042 for Thoracic Spine MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces high quality multiplanar images of organs and \nstructures within the body without using ionizing radiation. It is used for evaluation, \nassessment of severity, and follow-up of diseases of the spine and is the preferred modality \nfor imaging intervertebral disc degeneration. High contrast resolution (soft tissue contrast) \nand multiplanar imaging (sagittal as well as axial planes) are helpful in the evaluation of \npossible disc herniation and detecting nerve root compression. MRI is one of the most useful \ntechniques to evaluate spine infection and is also used to evaluate tumors, cancer, and \nimmune system suppression. \n\nSpecial Note \n+If there is a combination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the same \ntime or sequentially (within the past 3 months): \n\n\u25cf The results of the prior study should be inconclusive or show a need for additional or \nfollow-up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient (the entire spinal cord \nand/or autonomic postganglionic chain must be assessed). \n\n \n(*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR THORACIC SPINE MRI \nEvaluation of Neurologic Deficits  (1,2) \n\n\u25cf With any of the following new neurological deficits documented on physical exam \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 042 for Thoracic Spine MRI \n\n\u25cb Extremity muscular weakness (and not likely caused by plexopathy or peripheral \nneuropathy)(3) \n\n\u25cb Pathologic (e.g., Babinski, Lhermitte's sign(4), Chaddock Sign(5), Hoffman\u2019s and \nother upper motor neuron signs); OR abnormal deep tendon reflexes (and not \nlikely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy)  \n\n\u25cb Absent/decreased sensory changes along a particular thoracic dermatome (nerve \ndistribution): pin prick, touch, vibration, proprioception, or temperature weakness \n(and not likely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy) \n\n\u25cb Upper or lower extremity increase muscle tone/spasticity and likely localized to \nthe thoracic spinal cord  \n\n\u25cb New onset bowel or bladder dysfunction (e.g., retention or incontinence)\u2014not \nrelated to an inherent bowel or bladder process \n\n\u25cb Gait abnormalities, most likely cause by a suspected or known myelopathy (see \nTable 1 below for more details) \n\n\u25cf Suspected thoracic cord compression with any neurological deficits as listed above \n\nEvaluation of Back Pain  (6,7) \nWith any of the following \n\n\u25cf With new or worsening objective neurologic deficits (as listed above) on exam \n\n\u25cf Failure of conservative treatment* for a minimum of six (6) weeks within the last six \n(6) months; \n\nNOTE - Failure of conservative treatment is defined as one of the following: \n\n\u25cb Lack of meaningful improvement after a full course of treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Progression or worsening of symptoms during treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Documentation of a medical reason the member is unable to participate in \ntreatment \n\nClosure of medical or therapy offices, patient inconvenience, or noncompliance \nwithout explanation does not constitute \u201cinability to complete\u201d treatment. \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment* \n\n\u25cf With an abnormal electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study (if performed) \nindicating a thoracic radiculopathy.

Guideline 044 for Lumbar Spine MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used in the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of \nspine-related conditions, e.g., degenerative disc disease, cauda equine compression, \nradiculopathy, infections, or cancer in the lumbar spine. MRI provides high quality \nmultiplanar images of organs and structures within the body without the use of x-rays or \nradiation. In the lumbar area where gonadal exposure may occur, MRI\u2019s lack of radiation is \nan advantage. \n\nSpecial Note \n+If there is a combination request* for an overlapping body part, either requested at the \nsame time or sequentially (within the past 3 months):  \n\n\u25cf The results of the prior study should be inconclusive or show a need for additional or \nfollow-up imaging evaluation OR \n\n\u25cf The office notes should clearly document an indication why overlapping imaging is \nneeded and how it will change management for the patient. \n\n \n(*Unless approvable in the combination section as noted in the guidelines) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR LUMBAR SPINE MRI \nEvaluation of Neurologic Deficits  (1,2) \n\n\u25cf With any of the following new neurological deficits documented on physical exam \n\n\u25cb Extremity muscular weakness (and not likely caused by plexopathy or peripheral \nneuropathy)(3) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 19 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 044 for Lumbar Spine MRI \n\n\u25cb Pathologic or abnormal reflexes (and not likely caused by plexopathy, or \nperipheral neuropathy)(4) \n\n\u25cb Absent/decreased sensory changes along a particular lumbar dermatome (nerve \ndistribution):  pin prick, touch, vibration, proprioception or temperature (and not \nlikely caused by plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy) \n\n\u25cb Lower extremity increased muscle tone \n\n\u25cb New onset bowel or bladder dysfunction (e.g., retention or incontinence)\u2014not \nrelated to an inherent bowel or bladder process \n\n\u25cb Gait abnormalities (see Table 1 below for more details) \n\n\u25cb New onset foot drop (Not related to a peripheral nerve injury, e.g., peroneal \nnerve) \n\n\u25cf Cauda Equina Syndrome as evidence by severe back pain/sciatica along with one of \nthe defined symptoms (see Cauda Equina Syndrome section) \n\nEvaluation of Back Pain  (5) \nWith any of the Following: \n\n\u25cf With new or worsening objective neurologic deficits on exam, as above \n\n\u25cf Failure of conservative treatment* for a minimum of six (6) weeks within the last six \n(6) months; \n\nNOTE - Failure of conservative treatment is defined as one of the following: \n\n\u25cb Lack of meaningful improvement after a full course of treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Progression or worsening of symptoms during treatment; OR \n\n\u25cb Documentation of a medical reason the member is unable to participate in \ntreatment \n\nClosure of medical or therapy offices, patient inconvenience, or noncompliance without \nexplanation does not constitute \u201cinability to complete\u201d treatment. \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment* \n\n\u25cf With an abnormal electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study (if performed) \nindicating a lumbar radiculopathy. (EMG is not recommended to determine the cause \nof axial lumbar, thoracic, or cervical spine pain)(6) \n\n\u25cf Isolated back pain in pediatric population(7,8) (conservative care not required if red \nflags present).

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nSpinal magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) allows for more effective and noninvasive \nscreening for vascular lesions than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone. It may \nimprove characterization of normal and abnormal intradural vessels while maintaining good \nspatial resolution.  \n\nSpinal MRA may be used for the evaluation of spinal arteriovenous malformations, as well \nas injuries to blood vessels supplying the spine and cord. \n\nINDICATIONS FOR SPINAL CANAL MAGNETIC \nRESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY (MRA) \n\n\u25cf Evaluation of spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM)(1,2,3,4) \n\n\u25cf Myelopathy when the suspected etiology is a compromise of blood flow or drainage \nto the spinal cord(5) \n\n\u25cf Evaluation of a known cervical spine fracture, disc herniation, infection, or venous \nthrombosis where there is concern for vascular pathology (compression or \nthrombosis) compromising spinal cord blood flow or venous drainage(6) \n\n\u25cf Evaluation of known or suspected vertebral artery injury when there is also concern \nfor vascular compromise to the spinal canal and its contents (otherwise neck MRA or \nCTA is sufficient to evaluate vertebral artery injury)(7) \n\n\u25cf Preoperative evaluation (e.g., localization of the spinal arteries prior to complex \nspinal surgery, aortic aneurysm repair, or characterization of suspected vascular \nlesion of the spinal canal and its contents)(8,9) \n\n\u25cf Follow-up study may be needed to help evaluate a patient\u2019s progress after treatment, \nprocedure, intervention, or surgery. Documentation requires a medical reason that \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 3 of 6 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 046 for Spinal Canal MRA/MRV \n\nclearly indicates why additional imaging is needed for the type and area(s) \nrequested.(1) \n\nFurther Evaluation of Indeterminate Findings on Prior \nImaging \nUnless follow up is otherwise specified within the guideline \n\n\u25cf For initial evaluation of an inconclusive finding on a prior imaging report that requires \nfurther clarification  \n\n\u25cf One follow-up exam of a prior indeterminate MR/CT finding to ensure no suspicious \ninterval change has occurred. (No further surveillance unless specified as highly \nsuspicious or change was found on last follow-up exam). \n\nCODING AND STANDARDS \nCoding \nCPT Codes \n72159 \n\nApplicable Lines of Business \n\u2612 CHIP (Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) \n\u2612 Commercial \n\u2612 Exchange/Marketplace \n\u2612 Medicaid \n\u2612 Medicare Advantage \n\nBACKGROUND \nSpinal MR Angiography/MR Venography (10) \nTypically, contrast-enhanced 3D time of flight techniques and contrast-enhanced CT \nangiography (CTA) have been used for evaluation of the spinal arteries, veins, and related \npathology as a non-invasive alternative to the gold standard catheter angiography. Magnetic \nresonance angiography is well suited to patients who cannot receive iodinated contrast. CTA \nhas the advantage over MRA of providing greater spatial resolution, can image the entire \nspine during one contrast bolus, and provides for a faster exam time that is less prone to \nmotion artifact. MRA is limited by a finite field of view, typically \u2264 50 cm. (8) MRI has the \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 6 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 046 for Spinal Canal MRA/MRV \n\nadvantage over CT of detecting areas of ischemia via diffusion weighted imaging as is very \nsensitive in detecting recurrent spinal arteriovenous fistulas post-treatment. (1) \n\nSpinal Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs) \nSpinal cord arteriovenous malformations are comprised of snarled tangles of arteries and \nveins that affect the spinal cord. They are fed by spinal cord arteries and drained by spinal \ncord veins. Spinal dural arteriovenous (AV) fistulas are the most encountered vascular \nmalformation of the spinal cord and are a treatable cause of progressive paraparesis. \nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can record the pattern and velocity of blood flow \nthrough vascular lesions as well as the flow of cerebrospinal fluid throughout the spinal cord. \nMRA can define the vascular malformation and may assist in determining treatment. (11) \n\nSpinal Arteries/Veins \nVascular malformations, trauma, disc herniations, neoplasms, and coagulopathies or \ninfection causing thrombosis can compromise the spinal cord blood supply and drainage. \nThe spinal cord arterial supply is derived from the anterior spinal artery, posterolateral spinal \nartery, and the arteria radicularis magna or artery of Adamkiewicz (AKA). The anterior spinal \nartery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the cord and arises from the vertebral arteries. It \nreceives contributions from the ascending cervical artery, the inferior thyroid artery, the \nintercostal arteries, the lumbar artery, the iliolumbar artery, lateral sacral arteries, and the \nAKA. The AKA arises on the left side of the aorta between the T8 and L1 segments, to \nanastomose with the anterior spinal artery and supply the lower two-thirds of the spinal cord. \nTwo posterolateral spinal arteries arise from the posteroinferior cerebellar arteries and \nsupply the posterior third (posterior columns, posterior roots, and dorsal horns) of the spinal \ncord. The spinal venous system is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic veins differentiated by \ntheir location within the spinal canal or extrinsic to the canal, respectively. They drain into the \nradiculomedullary veins, subsequently to paravertebral and intervertebral plexuses, then to \nthe segmental veins that eventually drain into the ascending lumbar veins, azygos system, \nand pelvic venous plexuses. \n\nContraindication and Preferred Studies \nContraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: impaired \nrenal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on trimester) \n\nContraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, patient \nexceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 6 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 046 for Spinal Canal MRA/MRV \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nMay 2024 \u25cf Updated references and background  \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and preferred studies section added to the \nbackground \n\nMay 2023 \u25cf Updated references \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of indeterminate \nfindings on prior imaging \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) generates images of the arteries that can be \nevaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms. It is used to evaluate the \narteries of the abdominal aorta and the renal arteries.  CTA uses ionizing radiation and \nrequires the administration of iodinated contrast agent, which is a potential hazard in patients \nwith impaired renal function. It is not appropriate as a screening tool for asymptomatic \npatients without a previous diagnosis. \n\nSpecial Note \nFor conditions where both abdomen and pelvis imaging are needed and/or the disease \nprocess is reasonably expected to involve both the abdomen and pelvis, requests should be \nresubmitted as CPT 74174. See Evolent Clinical Guideline 069 for Abdomen Pelvis CTA for \ncoverage indications. \n\nWhen vascular imaging of the aorta and both legs with Runoff is desired (sometimes \nincorrectly requested as Abd/Pelvis CTA & Lower Extremity CTA), only one authorization \nrequest is required, using CPT Code 75635 CT Angiography, Abdominal Aorta with Lower \nExtremity Runoff. This study provides for imaging of the abdomen, pelvis, and both legs.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR PELVIS CTA (ANGIOGRAPHY) \nVenous Disease \n\n\u25cf Evaluation of suspected pelvic vascular disease or pelvic congestive syndrome when \nfindings on ultrasound are indeterminate (1) \n\n\u25cf Unexplained lower extremity edema (typically unilateral or asymmetric) with negative \nor inconclusive Abdomen and/or Pelvis CT (2) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 3 of 8 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 038 for Pelvis CTA \n\n\u25cf Evaluation of venous thrombosis in the inferior vena cava (3) \n\n\u25cf Venous thrombosis if previous studies (such as ultrasound) have not resulted in a \nclear diagnosis (4) \n\n\u25cf Suspected May-Thurner Syndrome (iliac vein compression syndrome) when imaging \nof the abdomen is not needed (5,6) \n\nOther Vascular Abnormalities seen on Prior Imaging \nStudies \nFor Findings Limited to the Pelvis \n\n\u25cf Initial evaluation of inconclusive vascular findings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf For evaluation or monitoring of pelvic vascular disease when ultrasound is \ninconclusive (5,7,8,9,10,11,12) \n\n\u25cb Includes abnormalities such as aneurysm, dissection, arteriovenous \nmalformations (AVM), vascular fistula, intramural hematoma, compression \nsyndromes and vasculitis involving any of the following: inferior vena cava, iliac \narteries/veins and/or other pelvic blood vessels \n\n\u25cf Suspected complications of known aneurysm as evidenced by clinical findings such \nas new onset of pelvic pain \n\nEvaluation of Tumor \n\u25cf When needed for clarification of vascular invasion from tumor (13,14) \n\n\u25cf For imaging of the deep inferior epigastric arteries prior to breast reconstructive \nsurgery and abdominal imaging is not needed \n\nPre-Operative Evaluation (15,16) \n\u25cf Evaluation of interventional vascular procedures prior to endovascular aneurysm \n\nrepair (EVAR), or for luminal patency versus restenosis due to conditions such as \natherosclerosis, thromboembolism, and intimal hyperplasia \n\n\u25cf For imaging of the deep inferior epigastric arteries prior to breast reconstructive \nsurgery and only pelvic imaging is needed (i.e. Abdomen CTA not requested) (16) \n\n\u25cf Prior to uterine artery embolization for fibroids (MRA preferred) (17) \n\n\u25cf Evaluation of vascular anatomy prior to solid organ transplantation \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 8 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 038 for Pelvis CTA \n\nPost-Operative/Post-Procedural Evaluation \n\u25cf Follow-up study may be needed to help evaluate a patient\u2019s progress after treatment, \n\nprocedure, intervention, or surgery.

It is not appropriate as a \nscreening tool for asymptomatic patients without a previous diagnosis.  \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nPage 3 of 8 \nPelvis CTA (Angiography) \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc. \n\u00a9 2008-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\nPage 4 of 8 \nPelvis CTA (Angiography) \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc. \n\u00a9 2008-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\nCT/MRI and acute hemorrhage: MRI is not indicated. MRA/MRV  is rarely indicated for \nevaluation of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, particularly in the acute setting. \n\nCT is the study of choice due to its availability, speed of the study and less susceptibility to \nartifact from patient motion. Advances in technology have allowed conventional CT to not just \ndetect hematomas but to also identify the source of acute vascular extravasation. In special \ncases, finer vascular detail to assess the specific  vessel responsible for hemorrhage may require \nthe use of CTA. CTA in diagnosis of lower gastrointestinal bleeding is such an example.19  \nMRA/MRV can be utilized in non-acute situations to assess vascular structure involved in \natherosclerotic disease and its complications, such as vasculitis, venous thrombosis, vascular \ncongestion, or tumor invasion. Although some of these conditions may be associated with \nhemorrhage, bleeding  is usually not the primary reason why MRI/MRA/MRV is selected for the \nevaluation. A special condition where MRI may be superior to CT for evaluating hemorrhage is \nto detect an underlying neoplasm as the cause of bleeding.20 \n\nFollow-up of asymptomatic, incidentally detected iliac artery aneurysms: The definition of an \niliac artery aneurysm (IAA) is dilatation to more than 1.5 times its normal diameter; in general, \na common iliac artery \u2265 18 mm in men and \u2265 15 mm in women; an internal iliac artery (IIA) > 8 \nmm is considered aneurysmal.  \n\nIliac aneurysm ultrasound screening intervals: \n\n\u2022 Aneurysm size 2.0 -2.9 cm, every 3 years\n\u2022 Aneurysm size 3.0-3.4 cm, annually\n\u2022 Aneurysm size > 3.5 cm, every 6 months5\n\n\n\nPage 5 of 8 \nPelvis CTA (Angiography) \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc. \n\u00a9 2008-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1. \u010cert\u00edk B, T\u0159e\u0161ka V, Mol\u00e1\u010dek J, \u0160ulc R.

Guideline 036 for Pelvis CT \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nPelvis Computed Tomography (CT) uses radiation to generate images of the organs and \nstructures in the pelvis. Pelvic imaging begins at the umbilicus or iliac crests and extends to \nthe level of the lesser trochanters. \n\nSpecial Note \nNote: PELVIS CT ALONE SHOULD ONLY BE APPROVED WHEN DISEASE PROCESS IS \nSUSPECTED TO BE LIMITED TO THE PELVIS. CT Abdomen/Pelvis Combo (CPT Codes: \n74176, 74177, 74178) is the correct study when the indication(s) include both the abdomen \nAND pelvis, such as CTU (CT Urography), CTE (CT Enterography), acute abdominal pain, \nwidespread inflammatory disease or neoplasm. \n\nWhen separate requests for CT abdomen and CT Pelvis are encountered for processes \ninvolving both the abdomen and pelvis, they need to be resubmitted as a single \nAbdomen/Pelvis CT (to avoid unbundling). Otherwise, the exam should be limited to the \nappropriate area (i.e., Abdomen OR Pelvis) which includes the specific organ, area of known \ndisease/abnormality, or the area of concern. \n\nINDICATIONS FOR PELVIS CT \nPelvic Pain for Unknown Etiology \n\n\u25cf CT allowed after initial workup is inconclusive and must include results of the \nfollowing:(1) \n\n\u25cb Initial imaging,

history of fistula limited to the pelvis that requires re-evaluation or is \nsuspected to have recurred \n\n\u25cf Infection \n\n\u25cb Suspected infection in the pelvis (based on elevated WBC, fever, anorexia, or \nnausea and vomiting) \n\n\u25cb Complications of diverticulitis limited to the pelvis (prior imaging study is not \nrequired for diverticulitis diagnosis) with severe abdominal pain or severe \ntenderness or mass, not responding to antibiotic treatment \n\n\u25cb Any known infection to have created an abscess in the pelvis that requires re-\nevaluation \n\n\u25cf Stricture \n\n\u25cb Suspected urethral stricture or periurethral pathology after initial evaluation with \ncystoscopy or urethroscopy and additional imaging is needed (such as for \nsuspected malignancy, diverticula, fistula or extensive fibrosis OR for \npreoperative planning) \n\n\u25cf Fluid Collection \n\n\u25cb Abnormal fluid collection seen on prior imaging that needs follow-up evaluation \nand limited to the pelvis \n\nSuspected or Known Hernia (7) \n\u25cf For pelvic pain due to a suspected occult, spigelian, or incisional hernia when \n\nphysical exam and prior imaging are non-diagnostic or equivocal or if requested as a \npreoperative study \n\n\u25cf For confirming the diagnosis of a recurrent hernia when ultrasound is negative or \nnon-diagnostic \n\n\u25cf Hernia with suspected complications (e.g., bowel obstruction or strangulation, or non-\nreducible) based on symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, hematochezia, vomiting, severe pain), \nphysical exam (guarding, rebound) or prior

037 for Pelvis MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nPelvis Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) generates images of the organs and structures \nwithin the pelvis without the use of ionizing radiation.  \n\nSpecial Note \n\u25cf There is no MRI Abdomen/Pelvis combo (comparable to a CT Abdomen/Pelvis) such \n\nthat if imaging of both the abdomen and pelvis are indicated, two separate exams \n(and authorization) are required (i.e., MRI Abdomen and MRI Pelvis) \n\n\u25cf For evaluating the placenta or imaging the maternal pelvis without need for fetal \nassessment, use the Pelvic MRI guideline. When assessment of the fetus is needed, \nsee Fetal MRI (Evolent_CG_110) Guideline for indications.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR PELVIC MRI \nInflammatory Bowel Disease \n\n\u25cf For evaluation of

Inactive components, such as rest, ice, heat, modified \nactivities, medical devices, acupuncture and/or stimulators, medications, injections (epidural, \nfacet, bursal, and/or joint, not including trigger point), and diathermy can be utilized.  Active \nmodalities may consist of physical therapy, a physician-supervised home exercise \nprogram**, and/or chiropractic care.   \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 13 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 037 for Pelvis MRI \n\n**Home Exercise Program (HEP) \nThe following elements are required to meet guidelines for completion of conservative \ntherapy:  \n\n\u25cf Information provided on exercise prescription/plan AND    \n\n\u25cf Follow up with member with documentation provided regarding lack of improvement \n(failed) after completion of HEP (after suitable 4-week period), or inability to complete \nHEP due to physical reason- i.e., increased pain, inability to physically perform \nexercises. (Patient inconvenience or noncompliance without explanation does not \nconstitute \u201cinability to complete\u201d HEP). \n\n\u25cf Dates and duration of failed PT, physician-supervised HEP, or chiropractic treatment \nshould be documented in the original office notes or an addendum to the notes. \n\nMRI and Lumbosacral Plexopathy \nComplete lumbar (L1-L4) or sacral plexopathy (L5-S3) may present with weakness, sensory \nloss, and flaccid loss of tendon reflexes. Clinical diagnosis is confirmed by EMG. Acute and \nchronic plexopathies may be caused by nerve sheath tumors; infectious, autoimmune, \nhereditary, or idiopathic neuropathies; extrinsic compression; or trauma. There is no CPT\u00ae \ncode specifically for imaging of the LS plexus. \n\nPudendal neuralgia may be considered in chronic pain patients who meet the Nantes \ncriteria: pain in the area innervated by the pudendal nerve, pain more severe with sitting, \npain that does not awaken the patient from sleep, pain with no objective sensory impairment, \nand pain relieved by pudendal block. All five criteria must be met for diagnosis. \n\nElevated CA-125 and Pelvic Imaging \nThere is no evidence that isolated levels of CA-125 with no other clinical or radiologic \nevidence of pathology is sensitive or specific and should not be performed as an isolated \ntest as it can lead to unnecessary studies and anxiety.  It is elevated in most cases of \nepithelial ovarian cancer and is used in monitoring response to treatment as an adjunct to \npelvic US. CA-125 has been shown to be increased in many conditions such as fibroids, \nadenomyosis, pancreatic cancer, endometriosis, tuberculosis, and interstitial lung disease. \nMRI is not indicated as a first-line test. \n\nFever of Unknown Origin \nInitial work up prior to CT would include a comprehensive history, repeated physical exam, \ncomplete blood count with differential, three sets of blood cultures, chest x-ray, complete \nmetabolic panel, urinalysis, ESR, ANA, RA, CMV IgM antibodies, virus detection in blood, \nheterophile antibody test, tuberculin test, and HIV antibody test. Lastly, with a negative CXR, \nonly when initial workup and abdomen/pelvis CT/MR fail to identify the cause for fever can \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 14 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 037 for Pelvis MRI \n\nChest CT be approved. If CXR suggests a malignancy and/or source of fever, then Chest CT \nwould be approved. \n\nParaneoplastic Syndromes \nSuspected paraneoplastic syndromes with no established cancer diagnosis: laboratory \nevaluation and imaging \n\nThe laboratory evaluation for paraneoplastic syndrome is complex. If the appropriate lab test \nresults are suspicious for malignancy, imaging is indicated. \n\nFor SIADH (hyponatremia + increased urine osmolality), there is a high association with \nsmall cell lung cancer, therefore imaging typically starts with chest CT. If other symptoms \nsuggest a different diagnosis other than small cell lung cancer, different imaging studies may \nbe reasonable. \n\nFor hypercalcemia (high serum calcium, low-normal PTH, high PTHrP) it is reasonable to \nstart with bone imaging followed by a more directed evaluation such as mammogram, chest, \nabdomen and pelvis imaging as appropriate. \n\nFor Cushing syndrome (hypokalemia, normal-high midnight serum ACTH NOT suppressed \nwith dexamethasone) abdominal and chest imaging is reasonable. If dexamethasone \nsuppression test DOES suppress ACTH, pituitary MRI is reasonable. \n\nFor hypoglycemia, labs drawn during a period of hypoglycemia (glucose < 55, typically a 72 \nhour fast) (insulin level, C-peptide and IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio) should be done to evaluate for an \ninsulinoma. An elevated insulin level, elevated C-peptide and/or normal IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio \nwarrants CT or MRI abdomen to look for insulinoma. A low insulin, low C-peptide and/or \nelevated IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio warrants chest and abdominal imaging. \n\nWhen a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome is suspected, nuclear and cytoplasmic \nantibody panels are often ordered to further identify specific tumor types. Results are needed \nprior to imaging. Because these tests are highly specific, if an antibody highly associated \nwith a specific cancer is positive, then further imaging for that cancer is reasonable. For \nexample, anti-Hu has a high association with SCLC and chest CT would be reasonable. \nAnti-MA2 has a high association with testicular cancer and testicular ultrasound would be a \nreasonable next step. \n\nWeight Loss \nUnintentional weight loss is considered clinically significant if the amount of weight lost over \n12 months is \u2265 5%. Older age and higher percentage of weight loss correlates with higher \nlikelihood of malignancy. A targeted evaluation is recommended when there are signs or \nsymptoms suggestive of a specific source. For example, when there is clinically significant \nweight loss with abdominal pain that prompts an evaluation for an abdominal source of the \nweight loss; CXR and labs such as TSH would not be needed prior to abdominal imaging. \nConversely a smoker with a cough and weight loss would not start with abdominal imaging, \na chest x-ray (CXR) would be the first test to start with. When there is no suspected \ndiagnosis, initial evaluation includes CXR, age-appropriate cancer screening (such as \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 15 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 037 for Pelvis MRI \n\ncolonoscopy and mammography) and labs (including CBC, CMP, HbA1C, TSH, stool \nhemoccult, ESR/CRP, HIV, Hepatitis C). If this initial evaluation fails to identify a cause of \nweight loss, then the patient is monitored and if progressive weight loss is seen on \nsubsequent visits/weights, then CT Abdomen/Pelvis is reasonable (MRI if there is a \ncontraindication to CT such as contrast allergy or impaired renal function). Lastly, with a \nnegative CXR, only when initial workup and abdomen/pelvis CT/MR fail to identify the cause \nfor weight loss can Chest CT be approved. If CXR suggests a malignancy and/or source of \nweight loss, then Chest CT would be approved.  \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Revised the purpose  \n\n\u25cf Clarified when to use Fetal MRI and Pelvis MRI  \n\u25cf Made Inflammation and Infection section to re-organize \n\ninformation  \n\u25cf Clarified gynecologic reasons of why MRI vs CT  \n\u25cf Prostate Cancer condensed in the suspected section  \n\u25cf Known Malignancy was adjusted to follow same organization \n\nas other guidelines  \n\u25cf Genetics and Rate Diseases was adjusted/added  \n\u25cf Combination studies were adjusted to align across \n\nGuidelines  \nMarch 2023 \u25cf Prostate cancer: updated guidance based on new NCCN \n\ncriteria \n\u25cf IBD: clarified indications \n\u25cf Hernia: added indication for deep pelvic hernia \n\u25cf Musculoskeletal: additional guidance provided for hip imaging, \n\nnon-diagnostic requests added, corrected statement requiring \nabnormal x-ray to requiring prior x-ray \n\n\u25cf Other: specified guidance for weight loss, paraneoplastic \nsyndrome, edema; added indications for thrombocytopenia, \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 16 of 20 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 037 for Pelvis MRI \n\ngestational trophoblastic disease, cancer predisposition \nsyndromes \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm: added section about non-aortic vascular disease \n\u25cf Transplant: added section \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of indeterminate \nfindings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf Aligned sections across body imaging guidelines \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

Guideline 039 for Pelvis MRA/MRV (Angiography/Venography) \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and (MRV) generates images of the blood vessels \nthat can be evaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms without use of \nionizing radiation. It is used to evaluate the blood vessels of the pelvis. \n\nSpecial Note \nWhen the criteria for imaging of peripheral vascular disease are met (see relevant \nguidelines), two separate authorizations are required: Abdomen MRA (CPT 74185) and one \nLower Extremity MRA (CPT 73725). This will provide imaging of the abdomen, pelvis and \nboth legs. A separate Pelvis MRA authorization is NOT required. Only one Lower Extremity \nMRA is required (not two). \n\nINDICATIONS FOR PELVIS MR ANGIOGRAPHY/MR \nVENOGRAPHY (MRA/MRV) \nAbdominal Aortic Disease \nAbdominal Aortic Aneurysm \n\n\u25cf Asymptomatic known or suspected abdominal aortic aneurysms when prior \nultrasound is inconclusive or insufficient AND when CT/CTA is contraindicated or \ncannot be performed \n\n\u25cf Symptomatic known or suspected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm(1,2) \n\n\u25cb Symptoms may include: \n\n\u25a0 Abrupt onset of severe sharp or stabbing pain in the chest, back or abdomen \n\n\u25a0 Acute abdominal or back pain with a pulsatile or epigastric mass \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 039 for Pelvis MRA/MRV (Angiography/Venography) \n\n\u25a0 Acute abdominal or back pain and at high risk for aortic aneurysm and/or \naortic syndrome (risk factors include hypertension, atherosclerosis, prior \ncardiac or aortic surgery, underlying aneurysm, connective tissue disorder \n(e.g., Marfan syndrome, vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-\nDietz syndrome), and bicuspid aortic valve)(3) \n\nAortic Syndromes \nFor initial diagnosis of suspected and follow-up of known aortic syndromes, including aortic \ndissection, intramural hematoma and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer \n\n\u25cf Frequency for follow up is as clinically indicated \n\nPostoperative Follow-up of Aortic Repair \nFollow-up for post-endovascular repair (EVAR) or open repair of AAA(1) or abdominal extent \nof iliac artery aneurysms at the following intervals: \n\n\u25cf Routine, baseline post-EVAR study when CT/CTA is contraindicated or cannot be \nperformed: \n\n\u25cb Within one month of procedure \n\n\u25cb Continued follow up imaging at the following intervals: \n\n\u25a0 If no endoleak or sac enlargement is seen: \n\n\u25a1 Annually monitor with ultrasound \n\n\uf0bf When US is abnormal or insufficient CT/MR can be using to monitor \nannually \n\n\u25a1 Every 5 years monitor with CT/MR \n\n\u25a0 If type II endoleak or sac enlargement is seen at any point in time (US not \nneeded): \n\n\u25a1 Monitor every 6 months x 2 years, then annually (does not require US) \n\n\u25cf Routine follow up after open repair of AAA when CT/CTA is contraindicated or \ncannot be performed:(2) \n\n\u25cb Within 1 year postoperatively then \n\n\u25cb Annually monitor with ultrasound \n\n\u25a0 When US is abnormal or insufficient CT/MR can be used to monitor annually \n\n\u25cb Every 5 years monitor with CT/MR \n\n\u25cf If symptomatic or imaging shows increasing, or new findings related to stent graft \u2013 \nmore frequent imaging may be needed as clinically indicated \n\n\u25cf Suspected complication such as: new-onset lower extremity claudication, ischemia, \nor reduction in ABI after aneurysm repair \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 039 for Pelvis MRA/MRV (Angiography/Venography) \n\nIschemia or Hemorrhage \n\u25cf To determine the vascular source of retroperitoneal hematoma or hemorrhage when \n\nCT is insufficient to determine the source and CTA is contraindicated or cannot be \nperformed;

Aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta is defined as diameter \u2265 3.0 cm or \ndilatation of the aorta \u2265 1.5x the normal diameter. \n\nIliac Aneurysm Ultrasound Screening Intervals \n\u25cf Aneurysm size 2.0-2.9 cm, every 3 years \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm size 3.0-3.4 cm, annually \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm size > 3.5 cm, every 6 months(3) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 10 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 039 for Pelvis MRA/MRV (Angiography/Venography) \n\nMRI/CT and Acute Hemorrhage \nMRI is not indicated and MRA/MRV (MR Angiography/Venography) is rarely indicated for \nevaluation of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, particularly in the acute setting. \nCT is the study of choice due to its availability, speed of the study, and less susceptibility to \nartifact from patient motion. Advances in technology have allowed conventional CT to detect \nhematomas and the source of acute vascular extravasation. In special cases, finer vascular \ndetail to assess the specific source vessel responsible for hemorrhage may require the use \nof CTA (e.g., for the diagnosis of lower gastrointestinal bleeding).(37) \n\nMRA/MRV is often utilized in non-acute situations to assess vascular structure involved in \natherosclerotic disease with associated complications, vasculitis, venous thrombosis, \nvascular congestion, or tumor invasion. Although some may be associated with hemorrhage, \nit is usually not the primary reason why MRI/MRA/MRV is selected for the evaluation. A \nspecial condition where MRI may be superior to CT for evaluating hemorrhage is to detect \nan underlying neoplasm as the cause of bleeding.(4) \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nApril 2024 \u25cf Separated out aortic syndromes to be more clear \n\n\u25cf EVAR studies clarified order of which studies would be \nordered \n\n\u25cf Renal artery stenosis: updated per new clinical guidance \n\u25cf Added Genetic Syndromes and Tumors Section \n\u25cf Statement put in all Guidelines for contraindications put in \n\nindications and background sections \n\u25cf Combo section adjusted and made uniform \n\u25cf Updated references and background sections \n\nMarch 2023 \u25cf Aneurysm: specified guidance on initial imaging and \nscreening intervals with emphasis on requiring ultrasound on \ninitial imaging and indications for advanced imaging, specified \nguidance on post-repair imaging \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 11 of 14 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 039 for Pelvis MRA/MRV (Angiography/Venography) \n\n\u25cf Other vascular abnormalities: clarified indication for non-aortic \nvascular conditions \n\n\u25cf Transplant: added section \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of \nindeterminate findings on prior imaging \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

057-1 for Upper Extremity CT \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nComputed tomography (CT) may be used for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of \nconditions of the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder. CT is not usually the initial imaging test, \nbut it is performed after standard radiographs. CT may be used for preoperative evaluation \nor to evaluate specific abnormalities of the bones, joints, and soft tissues of the upper \nextremities. \n\nSpecial Note \n\u25cf Plain radiographs must precede CT evaluation, unless otherwise indicated \n\n\u25cf Some indications are for MRI, CT, or MR or CT Arthrogram. More than one should \nnot be approved at the same time. \n\n\u25cf If a CT Arthrogram fits approvable criteria below, approve as CT \n\nINDICATIONS FOR UPPER EXTREMITY CT \nJoint or Muscle Pain  (1,2) \nNegative Findings on Orthopedic Exam and after X-Ray Completed  and when MRI is \ncontraindicated or cannot be performed, or requested as a CT arthrogram \n\nNOTE: Does not apply to young children (up to age 12) \n\n\u25cf Persistent joint or musculotendinous pain unresponsive to conservative treatment*, \nwithin the last 6 months, which includes active medical therapy (physical therapy, \nchiropractic treatments, and/or physician supervised exercise**) of at least four (4) \nweeks \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 16 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 057-1 for Upper Extremity CT \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment \n\nJoint Specific Provocative Exam Tests and Suspected \nInjuries \nNOTE: when MRI is contraindicated or cannot be performed, or requested as a CT \narthrogram \n\nNOTE: With a positive orthopedic sign, an initial x-ray is always preferred. However, it is not \nrequired to approve advanced imaging.   A positive sign is weakness or pain.

Severe degrees of glenoid \nbone loss are shown on axial radiography, but it can be quantified more definitively using \nCT. This information is important to confirm that an \"off-track\" lesion is not present, as it \nhelps to predict the likelihood of further dislocation and the need for bone augmentation \n(Latarjet) or additional soft tissue (Remplissage) surgery. The number of dislocations cannot \nreliably predict the degree of glenoid bone loss; it is important to quantify glenoid bone loss, \ninitially by arthroscopy and later by CT. \n\nBone Fracture or Ligament Injury (19) \nIf MRI is contraindicated or cannot be performed \n\n\u25cf Suspected occult scaphoid fracture with snuffbox pain after initial x-ray \n\n\u25cf Non scaphoid suspected occult, stress or insufficiency fracture with a negative initial \nx-ray \n\n\u25cb Repeat x-rays in 10-14 days if negative or non-diagnostic \n\n\u25cf Pathologic fracture on x-ray or CT \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 7 of 16 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 057-1 for Upper Extremity CT \n\n\u25cf Suspected ligamentous/tendon injury with known fractures on x-ray/CT that may \nrequire surgery \n\nFracture Nonunion (20) \nNonunion or delayed union as demonstrated by no healing between two sets of x-rays. If a \nfracture has not healed by 4-6 months, there is delayed union.

Guideline 061-2 for Upper Extremity CTA/CTV \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nCTA/CTV \nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) generates images of the arteries that can be \nevaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms. It is used to evaluate the \narteries of the abdominal aorta and the renal arteries. CTA uses ionizing radiation and \nrequires the administration of iodinated contrast agent, which is a potential hazard in patients \nwith impaired renal function. Upper Extremity CTA is not used as a screening tool, e.g., \nevaluation of asymptomatic patients, without a previous diagnosis. \n\nNOTE: Authorization for MR Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging. The term \nangiography refers to both arteriography and venography. \n\nSpecial Note \nImaging Request \nWhen a separate CTA and CT exam is requested, documentation requires a medical reason \nthat clearly indicates why additional CT imaging of the upper extremity is needed. \n\nINDICATIONS \nHand Ischemia (1,2) \n\n\u25cf Acute symptoms (including): \n\n\u25cb Ischemic ulceration without segmental temperature change \n\n\u25cb Ischemic ulceration with painful ischemia \n\n\u25cb Acute sustained loss of perfusion with or without acral ulceration \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 9 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 061-2 for Upper Extremity CTA/CTV \n\n\u25cb Imminent loss of digit \n\nNOTE: Does not require prior arterial Doppler \n\n\u25cf For clinical symptoms, following abnormal arterial Doppler, when CTA results will \nchange management \n\n\u25cb Includes Raynaud\u2019s (can be associated with scleroderma), Buerger disease, and \nother vasculopathies (3) \n\n\u25cf Clinical concern for vascular cause of ulcers with abnormal or indeterminate \nultrasound (4) \n\n\u25cf After stenting or surgery with signs of recurrence or indeterminate ultrasound (5) \n\nDeep Venous Thrombosis or Embolism \n\u25cf After abnormal ultrasound of arm veins if it will change management \n\n\u25cf After negative or indeterminate ultrasound to rule out other causes \n\n\u25cf For evaluation of central veins \n\n\u25cf Clinical suspicion of upper arterial emboli (6,7) \n\nClinical Suspicion of Vascular Disease \nWith abnormal or indeterminate ultrasound (6,7), for suspicion of: \n\n\u25cf Tumor invasion (8,9) \n\n\u25cf Trauma (10) \n\n\u25cf Vasculitis (1,11) \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm (11) \n\n\u25cf Stenosis/occlusions (12) \n\nHemodialysis Graft Dysfunction \nIf Doppler ultrasound was not adequate for treatment decisions (13) \n\nVascular Malformation \nNOTE: (MRA preferred however CTA useful in delineating some high flow lesions such as \nan arteriovenous malformation) \n\n\u25cf After initial evaluation with ultrasound  \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 9 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 061-2 for Upper Extremity CTA/CTV \n\n\u25cf Preoperative planning \n\nA concurrent CT is also approvable for initial evaluation and/or preoperative planning  if MRI \nis contraindicated or cannot be performed, or per surgeon preference. \n\nTraumatic Injuries \nClinical findings suggestive of arterial injury (10) \n\nEvaluation of Tumor \nWhen needed for clarification of vascular invasion from tumor after prior imaging (may be \napproved in combination with CT or MRI of tumor) \n\nPre-Operative/Procedural Evaluations \nPre-operative evaluation for a planned surgery or procedure (14) \n\nPost-Operative/Procedural Evaluations \nA follow-up study may be needed to help evaluate a patient\u2019s progress after treatment, \nprocedure, intervention, or surgery (15,16).

Guideline 057-3 for Upper Extremity MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMRI \nMagnetic resonance imaging shows the soft tissues and bones. With its multiplanar \ncapabilities, high contrast, and high spatial resolution, it is an accurate diagnostic tool for \nconditions affecting the joint and adjacent structures.  \n\nSpecial Note \n\u25cf Plain radiographs must precede MRI evaluation unless otherwise indicated   \n\n\u25cf Some indications are for MRI, CT, or MR or CT Arthrogram (more than one should \nnot be approved at the same time) \n\n\u25cf If an MR Arthrogram fits approvable criteria below, approve as MRI \n\nINDICATIONS FOR UPPER EXTREMITY MRI \nJoint or Muscle Pain  (1,2) \nNegative Findings on Orthopedic Exam and after X-Ray Completed \n \nNOTE: Does not apply to young children (up to age 12) \n \n\n\u25cf Persistent joint or musculotendinous pain unresponsive to conservative treatment*, \nwithin the last 6 months which includes active medical therapy (physical therapy, \nchiropractic treatments, and/or physician supervised exercise**) of at least four (4) \nweeks \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 16 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 057-3 for Upper Extremity MRI \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment \n\nJoint Specific Provocative Exam Tests and Suspected \nInjuries \nApprovable Orthopedic Test \n \nWith a positive orthopedic sign, an initial x-ray is always preferred; however, it is not required \nto approve advanced imaging.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMRA/MRV \nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and (MRV) generates images of the blood vessels \nthat can be evaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms without use of \nionizing radiation. It is used to evaluate the blood vessels of the lower extremities. \n\nNOTE: Authorization for MR Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging. The term \nangiography refers to both arteriography and venography. \n\nSpecial Note \nImaging Request \nWhen a separate MRA and MRI exam is requested, documentation requires a medical \nreason that clearly indicates why additional MRI imaging of the upper extremity is needed. \n\nINDICATIONS \nHand Ischemia (1,2,3) \n\n\u25cf Acute symptoms including: \n\n\u25cb Ischemic ulceration without segmental temperature change \n\n\u25cb Ischemic ulceration with painful ischemia \n\n\u25cb Acute sustained loss of perfusion with or without acral ulceration \n\n\u25cb Imminent loss of digit \n\n\u25cb NOTE: Does not require prior arterial Doppler \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 9 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 058-2 for Upper Extremity MRA/MRV \n\n\u25cf For clinical symptoms, following abnormal arterial Doppler, when MRA results will \nchange management \n\n\u25cb Includes Raynaud\u2019s (can be associated with scleroderma), Buerger disease, and \nother vasculopathies(4) \n\n\u25cf Clinical concern for vascular cause of ulcers with abnormal or indeterminate \nultrasound(5) \n\n\u25cf After stenting or surgery with signs of recurrence or indeterminate ultrasound (6) \n\nDeep Venous Thrombosis or Embolism (7,8) \n\u25cf After abnormal ultrasound of arm veins if it will change management \n\n\u25cf After negative or indeterminate ultrasound to rule out other causes \n\n\u25cf Evaluation of central veins \n\n\u25cf Clinical suspicion of upper arterial emboli(9,10) \n\nClinical Suspicion of Vascular Disease \n Abnormal or indeterminate ultrasound or other imaging(9,10), for suspicion of: \n\n\u25cf Tumor invasion(11,12) \n\n\u25cf Trauma(13) \n\n\u25cf Vasculitis(2,14) \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm(11,14) \n\n\u25cf Stenosis/occlusions(15) \n\nHemodialysis Graft Dysfunction \nIf Doppler ultrasound was not adequate(16) for treatment decisions(17) \n\nVascular Malformation (18,19) \n\u25cf After initial evaluation with ultrasound   \n\n\u25cf Preoperative planning \n\nA concurrent MRI is also approvable for initial evaluation and/or preoperative planning \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 9 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 058-2 for Upper Extremity MRA/MRV \n\nTraumatic Injuries \nClinical findings suggestive of arterial injury (CTA preferred emergently)(13) \n\nEvaluation of Tumor \nWhen needed for clarification of vascular invasion from tumor after prior imaging (may be \napproved in combination with CT or MRI of tumor). \n\nPre-Operative/Procedural Evaluations \nPre-operative evaluation for a planned surgery or procedure(20) \n\nPost-Operative/Procedural Evaluations \nA follow-up study may be needed to help evaluate a patient\u2019s progress after treatment, \nprocedure, intervention, or surgery.(21) Documentation requires a medical reason that clearly \nindicates why additional imaging is needed for the type and area(s) requested. \n\nFurther Evaluation of Indeterminate Findings on Prior \nImaging \nUnless follow-up is otherwise specified within the guideline \n\n\u25cf For initial evaluation of an inconclusive finding on a prior imaging report (i.e., x-ray, \nultrasound or CT) that requires further clarification \n\n\u25cf One follow-up exam of a prior indeterminate MR/CT finding to ensure no suspicious \ninterval change has occurred.

the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMRI \nPlain radiographs are typically used as the first-line modality for assessment of lower \nextremity conditions. Computed tomography (CT) is used for evaluation of tumors, \nmetastatic lesions, infection, fractures, and other problems. Magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) is the first-line choice for imaging of many conditions, but CT may be used in these \ncases if MRI is contraindicated or unable to be performed. \n\nSpecial Note \n\u25cf Plain radiographs must precede CT evaluation unless otherwise indicated   \n\n\u25cf Some indications are for MRI, CT, or MR or CT Arthrogram (more than one should \nnot be approved at the same time) \n\n\u25cf If an CT Arthrogram fits approvable criteria below, approve as CT \n\n\u25cf MRI is usually the preferred study \n\nINDICATIONS FOR LOWER EXTREMITY CT (FOOT, \nANKLE, KNEE, LEG, OR HIP) \nPre-condition \nPlain radiographs must precede CT evaluation. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 18 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 057-2 for Lower Extremity CT \n\nJoint or Muscle Pain  (1,2,3) \nNegative Findings on Orthopedic Exam and after X-Ray Completed \n\nNOTE: Does not apply to young children (up to age 12).

may be useful for metal artifact reduction if available but is also imperfect as \nthe correction is based on a projected approximation of x-ray absorption, and it does not \ncorrect for scatter.(52)  Dual-energy CT can be used to characterize crystal deposition \ndisease, such as gout versus CPPD (calcium pyrophosphate deposition).(44) \n\nCT and Osteolysis \nComputed tomography scans show both the extent and the location of lytic lesions, they are \nuseful to guide treatment decisions, as well as to assist in planning for surgical intervention \nwhen needed, in patients with suspected osteolysis after Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). \n\nContraindication and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal

Guideline 061-1 for Lower Extremity CTA/CTV \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nCTA/CTV \nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) generates images of the arteries that can be \nevaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms. It is used to evaluate the \narteries of the abdominal aorta and the renal arteries. CTA uses ionizing radiation and \nrequires the administration of iodinated contrast agent, which is a potential hazard in patients \nwith impaired renal function. Lower Extremity CTA is not used as a screening tool, e.g., \nevaluation of asymptomatic patients without a previous diagnosis. \n\nNOTE: Authorization for MR Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging. The term \nangiography refers to both arteriography and venography \n\nSpecial Note \nImaging Request \nWhen a separate CTA and CT exam is requested, documentation requires a medical reason \nthat clearly indicates why additional CT imaging of the lower extremity is needed. \n\nINDICATIONS \nPeripheral Vascular Disease \nNOTE: When Aortograms CTA (CT Angiography) (CPT Code 75635) has not been \nrecently approved, when aortoiliac disease is not a concern, or the state of the aorta \nand iliac arteries is already known. \nFor evaluation of known or suspected lower extremity arterial disease: \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 061-1 for Lower Extremity CTA/CTV \n\n\u25cf For known or suspected peripheral arterial disease (such as claudication, or clinical \nconcern for vascular causes of ulcers) when non-invasive studies (pulse volume \nrecording, ankle-brachial index, toe brachial index, segmental pressures, or doppler \nultrasound) are abnormal or indeterminate OR \n\n\u25cf For critical Limb ischemia with ANY of the below clinical signs of peripheral artery \ndisease (prior ultrasound is not needed; if done and negative, CTA should still be \napproved) (1,2) \n\n\u25cb Ischemic rest pain \n\n\u25cb Tissue loss \n\n\u25cb Gangrene \n\n\u25cf After stenting or surgery with signs of recurrent symptoms, abnormal ankle/brachial \nindex, abnormal or indeterminate arterial Doppler, or abnormal or indeterminate \npulse volume recording (3) \n\nNOTE: When vascular imaging of the aorta and both legs, i.e., CTA aortogram and runoff is \ndesired (sometimes incorrectly requested as Abd/Pelvis CTA & Lower Extremity CTA \nRunoff), only one authorization request is required, using CPT Code 75635 CTA Aortogram. \nThis study provides for imaging of the abdomen, pelvis, and both legs. A separate \nauthorization for Lower Extremity CTA is NOT needed. If ONLY the Extremity CTA is \nrequested and Abdominal imaging is not needed, Lower Extremity CTA can be issued. \n\nPopliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome \nAfter abnormal arterial ultrasound and when imaging will change management (4) \n\nDeep Venous Thrombosis \nClinical suspicion of lower extremity DVT (when ultrasound is abnormal or inconclusive and \na positive study would change management) (5,6,7) \n\nClinical Suspicion of Vascular Disease \nWith abnormal or indeterminate ultrasound or other imaging \n\n\u25cf Trauma (8) \n\n\u25cf Vasculitis (9)(10) \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm (9) \n\n\u25cf Stenosis/occlusions (10) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 061-1 for Lower Extremity CTA/CTV \n\nHemodialysis Graft Dysfunction \nAfter Doppler ultrasound, if findings were not adequate for treatment decisions(11) \n\nVascular Malformation (12,13) \n\u25cf After initial evaluation with ultrasound if:  \n\n\u25cb Results will change management  \n\n\u25cb Results are inconclusive on ultrasound \n\n\u25cb If a known or suspected high flow lesion \n\n\u25cf A concurrent CT is also approvable for initial evaluation and/or preoperative planning \nif MRI is contraindicated or cannot be performed or surgeon preference. \n\nTraumatic Injuries \nClinical findings suggestive of arterial injury (8) \n\nPre-operative/Procedure Evaluation \nPre-operative evaluation for a planned surgery or procedure (14) \n\nPost-operative/Procedure Evaluation \nA follow-up study may be needed to help evaluate a patient\u2019s progress after treatment, \nprocedure, intervention, or surgery. Documentation requires a medical reason that clearly \nindicates why additional imaging is needed for the type and area(s) requested (15,16) \n\nEvaluation of Tumor \nWhen needed for clarification of vascular invasion from tumor after prior imaging (may be \napproved in combination with CT or MRI of tumor). \n\nGenetic Syndromes and Rare Diseases \n\u25cf Known vascular EDS (vEDS) with acute extremity pain and concern for \n\ndissection/rupture(17,18) \n\n\u25cf Vascular EDS (vEDS) surveillance imaging: with inconclusive ultrasound or \nultrasound suggestive of vascular pathology (17,18)  \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 6 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 061-1 for Lower Extremity CTA/CTV \n\n\u25cf Known Williams Syndrome: when there is concern for vascular disease based on \nabnormal exam or imaging findings (such as diminished pulses, bruits or signs of \ndiffuse thoracic aortic stenosis(19) \n\n\u25cf For other syndromes and rare diseases not otherwise addressed in the guideline, \ncoverage is based on a case-by-case basis using societal guidance \n\nFurther Evaluation of Indeterminate Findings on Prior \nImaging \nUnless follow-up is otherwise specified within the guideline: \n\n\u25cf For initial evaluation of an inconclusive finding on a prior imaging report (i.e., x-ray, \nultrasound or CT) that requires further clarification.  \n\n\u25cf One follow-up exam of a prior indeterminate MR/CT finding to ensure no suspicious \ninterval change has occurred. (No further surveillance unless specified as highly \nsuspicious or change was found on last follow-up exam.) \n\nCODING AND STANDARDS \nCoding \nCPT Codes \n73706 \n\nApplicable Lines of Business \n\u2612 CHIP (Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) \n\u2612 Commercial \n\u2612 Exchange/Marketplace \n\u2612 Medicaid \n\u2612 Medicare Advantage \n\nBACKGROUND \nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester). \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 7 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 061-1 for Lower Extremity CTA/CTV \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds weight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\nCTA and Screening: Peripheral Vascular Disease \nThe USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) does not recommend routine screening \nfor peripheral vascular disease in asymptomatic patients (20). High risk patients (e.g., \ndiabetics) may be screened with ABI (ankle brachial index) and duplex ultrasound. \nThe ankle- brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by \nthe systolic pressure of the upper arm. The normal range lies between 0.9-1.4. An ABI (21) of \nless than 0.9 is a reliable indicator of the presence of lower extremity PAD, indicating athero-\nocclusive arterial disease. The upper limit of normal ABI should not exceed 1.40. An ABI \n>1.40 is suggestive of arterial stiffening (i.e., medial arterial calcification) and is also \nassociated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events and is seen in elderly patients, \ntypically in those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD). \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nApril 2024 \u25cf Updated references \n\n\u25cf Added Genetics Syndromes and Rare Diseases, Evaluation \nof Tumor, and Contraindications and Preferred Studies \nsections \n\nApril 2023 \u25cf Updated references \n\u25cf Modified background section \n\u25cf Added vascular malformations \n\u25cf Added indeterminate prior imaging findings \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 8 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 061-1 for Lower Extremity CTA/CTV \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

Guideline 057-4 for Lower Extremity MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMRI \nMagnetic resonance imaging shows the soft tissues and bones. With its multiplanar \ncapabilities, high contrast, and high spatial resolution, it is an accurate diagnostic tool for \nconditions affecting the joint and adjacent structures.  \n\nMRI can positively influence clinicians\u2019 diagnoses and management plans for patients with \nconditions such as primary bone cancer, fractures, abnormalities in \nligaments/tendons/cartilage, septic arthritis, and infection/inflammation. \n\nSpecial Note \n\u25cf Plain radiographs must precede MRI evaluation unless otherwise indicated   \n\n\u25cf Some indications are for MRI, CT, or MR or CT Arthrogram (more than one should \nnot be approved at the same time) \n\n\u25cf If an MR Arthrogram fits approvable criteria below, approve as MRI \n\nINDICATIONS FOR LOWER EXTREMITY MRI \n(FOOT, ANKLE, KNEE, LEG, OR HIP) \nPre-condition \nPlain radiographs must precede MRI evaluation unless otherwise indicated. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 18 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 057-4 for Lower Extremity MRI \n\nJoint or Muscle Pain  (1,2,3) \nNegative Findings on Orthopedic Exam and after X-Ray Completed \n\nNOTE: Does not apply to young children (up to age 12) \n\n\u25cf Persistent joint or musculotendinous pain unresponsive to conservative treatment*, \nwithin the last 6 months which includes active medical therapy (physical therapy, \nchiropractic treatments, and/or physician supervised exercise**) of at least four (4) \nweeks \n\n\u25cf With progression or worsening of symptoms during the course of conservative \ntreatment \n\nJoint Specific Provocative Exam Tests and Suspected \nInjuries (4) \nApprovable Orthopedic Test \n\nWith a positive orthopedic sign, an initial x-ray is always preferred; however, it is not required \nto approve advanced imaging UNLESS otherwise specified in bold below.

Guideline 058-1 for Lower Extremity MRA/MRV \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMRA/MRV \nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and (MRV) generates images of the blood vessels \nthat can be evaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms without use of \nionizing radiation. It is used to evaluate the blood vessels of the lower extremities. \n\nNOTE: Authorization for MR Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging. The term \nangiography refers to both arteriography and venography. \n\nSpecial Note \nImaging Request \nWhen a separate MRA and MRI exam is requested, documentation requires a medical \nreason that clearly indicates why additional MRI imaging of the lower extremity is needed. \n\nINDICATIONS \nPopliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome \nAfter abnormal arterial ultrasound and when imaging will change management(1) \n\nDeep Venous Thrombosis \nClinical suspicion of lower extremity DVT (when ultrasound is abnormal or inconclusive and \na positive study would change management)(2,3,4) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 058-1 for Lower Extremity MRA/MRV \n\nClinical Suspicion of Vascular Disease \nAbnormal or indeterminate ultrasound or other imaging: \n\n\u25cf Tumor invasion(5,6) \n\n\u25cf Trauma(7) \n\n\u25cf Vasculitis(8) \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm(8) \n\n\u25cf Stenosis/occlusions(9) \n\nHemodialysis Graft Dysfunction \nAfter Doppler ultrasound, if findings were not adequate(10) for treatment decisions(11) \n\nVascular Malformation (11,12) \n\u25cf After initial evaluation with ultrasound if:  \n\n\u25cb Results will change management  \n\n\u25cb Results are inconclusive ultrasound   \n\n\u25cb If a known or suspected high flow lesion \n\n\u25cf For preoperative planning \n\n\u25cb MRI is also approvable for initial evaluation \n\nTraumatic Injuries \nClinical findings suggestive of arterial injury (CTA preferred if emergent) \n\nPeripheral Vascular Disease (9,13,14,15) \nFor evaluation of known or suspected lower extremity arterial disease when CTA is \ncontraindicated or cannot be performed: \n\n\u25cf For known or suspected peripheral arterial disease (such as claudication, or clinical \nconcern for vascular causes of ulcers) when non-invasive studies (pulse volume \nrecording, ankle-brachial index, toe brachial index, segmental pressures, or doppler \nultrasound) are abnormal or indeterminate OR \n\n\u25cf For critical limb ischemia with ANY of the below clinical signs of peripheral artery \ndisease (prior ultrasound is not needed; if done and negative, MRA should still be \napproved)(16,17) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 058-1 for Lower Extremity MRA/MRV \n\n\u25cb Ischemic rest pain \n\n\u25cb Tissue Loss \n\n\u25cb Gangrene \n\n\u25cf After stenting or surgery with signs of recurrent symptoms, abnormal ankle/brachial \nindex, abnormal or indeterminate arterial Doppler, or abnormal or indeterminate \npulse volume recording \n\nNOTE: As there is no CPT for MRA Aortogram with runoff, when the criteria above are met, \ntwo separate authorizations are required: Abdomen MRA (CPT 74185) and one Lower \nExtremity MRA (CPT 73725). This will provide imaging of the abdomen, pelvis and both legs. \nA separate Pelvis MRA authorization is NOT required. Only one Lower Extremity MRA is \nrequired (not two). \n\nEvaluation of Tumor \nWhen needed for clarification of vascular invasion from tumor after prior imaging (may be \napproved in combination with CT or MRI of tumor) \n\nPre-operative/Procedure Evaluation \nPre-operative evaluation for a planned surgery or procedure(13) \n\nPost-operative/Procedure Evaluation \nFollow-up study may be needed to help evaluate a patient\u2019s progress after treatment, \nprocedure, intervention, or surgery. Documentation requires a medical reason that clearly \nindicates why additional imaging is needed for the type and area(s) requested.(18,19) \n\nFurther Evaluation of Indeterminate Findings on Prior \nImaging \nUnless follow-up is otherwise specified within the guideline \n\n\u25cf For initial evaluation of an inconclusive finding on a prior imaging report (i.e., x-ray, \nultrasound or CT) that requires further clarification \n\n\u25cf One follow-up exam of a prior indeterminate MR/CT finding to ensure no suspicious \ninterval change has occurred. (No further surveillance unless specified as highly \nsuspicious or change was found on last follow-up exam.) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 6 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 058-1 for Lower Extremity MRA/MRV \n\nGenetics and Rare Diseases \n\u25cf Known vascular EDS (vEDS) with acute extremity pain and concern for \n\ndissection/rupture(20,21) \n\n\u25cf Vascular EDS (vEDS) surveillance imaging: with inconclusive ultrasound or \nultrasound suggestive of vascular pathology(20,21) \n\n\u25cf Known Williams Syndrome:  when there is concern for vascular disease based on \nabnormal exam or imaging findings (such as diminished pulses, bruits or signs of \ndiffuse thoracic aortic stenosis)(22) \n\n\u25cf For other syndromes and rare diseases not otherwise addressed in the guideline, \ncoverage is based on a case-by-case basis using societal guidance \n\nCombination Studies \nAbdomen MRA/Chest MRA/ and/or Lower Extremity MRA \n\n\u25cf To evaluate for an embolic source of lower extremity vascular disease. \nEchocardiography is also often needed, since the heart is the most commonly \nreported source of lower extremity emboli, accounting for 55 to 87 percent of events \n\nCODING AND STANDARDS \nCoding \nCPT Codes \n73725 \n\nApplicable Lines of Business \n\u2612 CHIP (Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) \n\u2612 Commercial \n\u2612 Exchange/Marketplace \n\u2612 Medicaid \n\u2610 Medicare Advantage \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 7 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 058-1 for Lower Extremity MRA/MRV \n\nBACKGROUND \nTesting \nNoninvasive Testing \n\u201cNoninvasive testing (NIVT), both before and after intervention, has been used as a first-line \ninvestigatory tool in the diagnosis and categorization of PAD. It is widely available, provides \na large amount of information, and is a low cost without the use of ionizing radiation.\"(19) \nNIVT can consist of one or more of the following components:(19) \n\n\u25cf ABI \n\n\u25cf Segmental pressure measurements (SPMs) \n\n\u25cf Pulse-volume recordings (PVRs) \n\n\u25cf Photoplethysmography (PPG) \n\n\u25cf Transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement (TcPO2) \n\nNoninvasive Hemodynamic Testing \nThe ankle- brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by \nthe systolic pressure of the upper arm. The normal range lies between 0.9-1.4. An ABI of \n<0.9 is a reliable indicator of the presence of lower extremity PAD, indicating athero-\nocclusive arterial disease. The upper limit of normal ABI should not exceed 1.40. An ABI \n>1.40 is suggestive of arterial stiffening (i.e., medial arterial calcification) and is also \nassociated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events and is seen in elderly patients, \ntypically in those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD). \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 8 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 058-1 for Lower Extremity MRA/MRV \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Content clarified without change to clinical indications \n\n\u25cf Added Genetics Syndrome and Rare Diseases section \n\u25cf Added Contraindications and Preferred Studies section in \n\nbackground \n\u25cf Combination Studies updated \n\u25cf Updated References \n\nApril 2023 \u25cf Updated references \n\u25cf Modified background section \n\u25cf Added vascular malformations \n\u25cf Added graft evaluation \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added indeterminate prior imaging findings \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

030 for Abdomen CT \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nAbdomen Computed Tomography (CT) uses radiation to generate images of the organs and \nstructures in the upper abdomen. Abdominal imaging begins at the diaphragm and extends \nto the umbilicus or iliac crests.   \n\nSpecial Note \n\u25cf Abdomen CT alone should ONLY be approved when disease process is suspected \n\nto be limited to the abdomen.  Abdomen/Pelvis CT (CPT Codes: 74176, 74177, \n74178) is the correct study when the indication(s) include both the abdomen AND \npelvis, such as CTU (CT Urography), CTE (CT Enterography), acute abdominal pain, \nwidespread inflammatory disease, or neoplasm.   \n\n\u25cf When separate requests for CT abdomen and CT Pelvis are encountered for \nprocesses involving both the abdomen and pelvis, they need to be resubmitted as a \nsingle Abdomen/Pelvis CT (to avoid unbundling; CPT codes 74176, 74177, 74178). \nOtherwise, the exam should be limited to the appropriate area (i.e., Abdomen OR \nPelvis) which includes the specific organ, area of known disease/abnormality, or the \narea of concern. \n\nINDICATIONS FOR ABDOMEN CT \nOrgan Specific Imaging \nAdrenal (1) \n\n\u25cf Indeterminate adrenal lesion seen on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf For further evaluation of suspected adrenal tumors and/or endocrine disorders when \nthere is clinical and laboratory evidence to suggest an adrenal source; see \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 18 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 030 for Abdomen CT \n\nBackground for specific laboratory testing that is needed based on suspected \ndiagnosis(2) \n\n\u25cf Adrenal mass < 4 cm incidentally discovered with benign characteristics \n(homogenous, regular borders, HU < 10), one follow-up at 6 months then annually x \n2 years (no further imaging if stable) \n\n\u25cf If adrenal mass \u2265 4 cm and no diagnosis of cancer, can approve for either pre-\noperative planning OR if surgery is not done, can repeat imaging in 6-12 months then \nas clinically indicated (if there is known malignancy, biopsy is typically the next step \nrather than surveillance imaging) \n\n\u25cf For follow up of known adrenal mass when a change in tumor is suspected by either \nimaging, laboratory evaluation and/or symptoms \n\n\u25cf See Genetic Syndromes and Rare Diseases for additional screening indications \n\nLiver \n\u25cf Indeterminate liver lesion seen on prior imaging(3) \n\n\u25cf For evaluation of rising AFP (requires a \u22657 ng/mL increased in AFP per month) in \npatients at high risk for HCC (known cirrhosis and/or chronic hepatitis B, see \nBackground for additional risk categories)(4) \n\n\u25cf For screening in patients at high risk for HCC (see above) every 6 months when prior \nultrasound is insufficient to evaluate the liver due to steatosis/fatty liver or nodular \nliver \n\n\u25cb The finding of steatosis/fatty liver and/or nodular liver alone on an ultrasound \nreport is insufficient for approval; the report must specify that those findings \nprevent adequate visualization of the liver by ultrasound \n\n\u25cf For jaundice or abnormal liver function tests after equivocal or abnormal \nultrasound(5,6) \n\n\u25cf For follow-up of suspected hepatocellular adenomas every 6-12 months for two \nyears, then annually (sooner if change was noted on last imaging study) (7,8) \n\n\u25cf For surveillance of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis every 6-12 months \nafter the age of 20 when MRI is contraindicated or cannot be performed(9) \n\n\u25cf For follow-up of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), repeat imaging in 6-12 months to \nensure stability.

Screening for pregnancy as part of a work-up is suggested to minimize the number of \nunexpected radiation exposures for women of childbearing age. \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nUltrasound should be considered prior to a request for Abdomen CT for the following evaluations: \n\u2022 Possible gallstones or abnormal liver function tests\n\u2022 Evaluation of cholecystitis\n\u2022 Follow up for aortic aneurysm\n\nLiver \n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Screening for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) \u2013 AASLD (American \nAssociation for the Study of Liver Diseases) recommends screening for HCC with ultrasound every 6 \nmonths for patients with hepatitis C and B.46 Advanced imaging is recommended when the AFP is \nrising, regardless of ultrasound results. The main risk factors for HCC are cirrhosis and Hepatitis B. \nAdditional populations for which there is a benefit to surveillance for HCC include: Asian males \nHepatitis B carriers \u2265 40 y, Asian female Hepatitis B carriers \u226550 y, Hepatitis B carriers with + family \nhistory of HCC and African and/or North American blacks with hepatitis B 13, 47.  \n\nSurveillance for HCC is required for patients who have received liver-directed therapy, surgical \nresection, medical treatment, or a transplant for HCC. However, because of the higher risk of tumor \nrecurrence, US is not typically used for surveillance for HCC in the first 2 years after treatment. The \nEuropean Association for the Study of the Liver recommends multiphase CT or MRI to assess response \n1 month after resection or locoregional or systemic therapies, followed by one imaging technique \nevery 3 months to complete at least 2 years, and then regular US every 6 months.  This schedule is \nmore frequent than some of the other society recommendations and the most common practice \namong interventional radiologists (every 3 months). \n\nImaging for pancreatitis \u2013 When acute pancreatitis is suspected, ultrasound is typically the first line \nimaging modality. The purpose of US is to identify other causes such as gallstones and/or biliary \ndilatation as well as help identify potential complications such as fluid collections. MRCP is preferred \nover CT for further evaluation of bile duct dilation. When a diagnosis other than pancreatitis is likely \n(such as when amylase and lipase are equivocal), CT or MRI may be indicated but would generally fall \nunder indications for acute abdominal pain. In general, CT is not indicated in patients with mild \npancreatitis who show rapid improvement with appropriate medical management. When a patient has \nor is at risk for severe pancreatitis, CT may be used after 72 hours to best assess the full extent of \ndisease. CT should be repeated when the clinical picture drastically changes, such as with sudden onset \nof fever, decrease in hematocrit or sepsis. For prolonged symptoms (>4 weeks) with known fluid \ncollection, CT or MRI is indicated. Common causes for pancreatitis include gallstones, alcohol, \n\nPage 8 of 17 \nAbdomen CT \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc\n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\nhypertriglyceridemia, post-ERCP, trauma. In patients over 40 years old, when no cause for pancreatitis \ncan be identified, advanced imaging is indicated to exclude neoplasm. \n\nAdrenal incidentaloma \u2013 Adrenal masses detected on imaging for another reason (i.e., incidental \nfinding) are becoming increasingly common. If there is no prior personal history of malignancy and no \nfeatures concerning for malignancy on imaging, these patients should undergo hormonal (functional) \nevaluation and periodic imaging. If the mass is < 4 cm on imaging and has benign characteristic \n(homogenous, regular borders, HU < 10) a hormonal evaluation should be done. If that evaluation is \nnegative, adrenal protocol/follow-up imaging can be performed at 6 months then annually for 1-2 \nyears12. Repeat functional studies are recommended annually (or sooner if symptoms) for 5 years. If \nthe mass exhibits growth or becomes hormonally active, then surgery is recommended 12. Additional \nimaging beyond 2 years is reasonable if there has been growth and the mass is not resected; if stable, \nno further imaging is warranted unless the annual hormonal evaluation is positive. Masses \u2265 4cm \ngenerally are resected after hormonal evaluation is completed, additional imaging can be approved \nwhen needed for further characterization for surgical planning. If the decision is made not to resect the \nmass, then FU imaging in 6-12 months is reasonable. \n\nBiochemically active tumors (adrenal and neuroendocrine): Laboratory evaluation prior to imaging - \nWhen neuroendocrine and hormonally active tumors are suspected, the required laboratory \nevaluation prior to advanced imaging is dependent on the tumor type that is suspected. The following \nlist describes suspected syndrome/tumor and typical laboratory evaluation in parenthesis: \n\nGI Carcinoid (24-hour urine or plasma 5-HIAA), Lung/Thymus Carcinoid (24-hour urine or plasma 5-\nHIAA AND one of the following: overnight dexamethasone suppression test, 2-3 midnight salivary \ncortisols, 24-hour urinary free cortisol), PPoma (serum pancreatic polypeptide), Insulinoma (serum \ninsulin, pro-insulin and C-peptide all drawn during a period of hypoglycemia (i.e. 72 hour fast)), VIPoma \n(serum VIP), glucagonoma (serum glucagon), gastrinoma (serum gastrin), somatostatinoma (serum \nsomatostatin), pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (plasma free or 24-hour urine fractionated \nmetanephrines and normetanephrines +/- serum or urine catecholamines), pituitary tumor (serum IGF-\n1, prolactin, LH/FSH, alpha subunits, TSH and ONE of the following: overnight dexamethasone \nsuppression test, 2-3 midnight salivary cortisols, 24-hour urinary free cortisol), primary \nhyperaldosteronism (suppressed renin/renin activity in association with elevated plasma aldosterone \n(>10 ng/dL) and confirmatory testing if positive), adrenocortical carcinoma (testosterone, DHEA-S AND \ncomplete evaluation for hypercortisolemia or primary aldosteronism)48. \n\nIf Cushing\u2019s (hypercortisolemia) is suspected, typical labs include a plasma ACTH AND one or more of \nthe following: overnight dexamethasone suppression test, 2-3 midnight salivary cortisols, OR 24-hour \nurinary free cortisol. The results of the suppression test then indicate whether brain imaging is needed \n(pituitary source) OR chest and abdominal imaging is needed (CXR + Adrenal CT/MRI). ACTH > 20 after \nsuppression > 20 is suggestive of Cushing\u2019s Disease and Pituitary MRI is indicated. ACTH after \nsuppression < 5 is suggestive of Cushing\u2019s Syndrome and CXR + Adrenal CT/MRI is indicated 49.

If there is no ACTH suppression with \nCRH/desmopressin, then adrenal imaging is indicated. \n\nGenetic syndromes and adrenal tumors \u2013 Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) diagnosed during \nchildhood is known to be commonly associated with hereditary syndromes, including Beckwith-\nWiedemann (BWS) and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). In adults, ACC may be associated with Multiple \nEndocrine Neoplasia 1 (MEN1), familial adenomatous polyposis coli and neurofibromatosis type 1 \n(NF1); however, there are currently no surveillance imaging recommendations.50 \n\nHigh risk characteristics for mucinous pancreatic cysts include all of the following: Symptoms, Jaundice \nsecondary to the cyst, acute pancreatitis secondary to the cyst, elevated serum CA 19-9 and no benign \ncause present, an enhancing mural nodule or solid component within the cyst or pancreas, main \npancreatic duct of > 5mm, change in duct caliber with upstream atrophy, size over 3 cm, high grade \ndysplasia or cancer on cytology. These patients should undergo EUS + -FNA or be referred to a \nmultidisciplinary group for further recommendations.51   \n\nGenetic syndromes and adrenal tumors - Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) diagnosed during childhood \nis known to be commonly associated with hereditary syndromes including Beckwith-Wiedemann (BWS) \nand Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). In adults, ACC may be associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 1 \n(MEN1), familial adenomatous polyposis coli and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1); however, there are \ncurrently no surveillance imaging recommendations.50 \n\nCT of the kidney - Recommendations for follow up of a complex cystic renal mass are made using \nBosniak criteria52: \n\n\u2022 Bosniak I (water density 0-20 HU); no further follow-up\n\u2022 Bosniak II (one or a few thin septations, small or fine calcifications, hyperdense cysts up to 3\n\ncm); no further follow-up\n\u2022 Bosniak IIF felt to be benign but too complex to be diagnosed with certainty; image at 6 and 12\n\nmonths, then annually for 5 years if no progression\n\u2022 Bosniak III thick-walled cystic lesions with wall or septal enhancement; resection favored vs\n\nconservative management and RFA in select cases31\n\n\u2022 Bosniak IV malignant cystic renal mass with enhancing soft tissue components; resection\nfavored, malignant until proven otherwise\n\nInsulinomas are rare pancreatic tumors. Localization of the tumor by ultrasound and CT are the preferred \ninitial options once a diagnosis has been made, followed by endoscopic ultrasound or arterial stimulation \nwith hepatic venous sampling. Whipple\u2019s triad includes symptoms of hypoglycemia, low blood glucose \nrelieved by ingestion of glucose, and benign 90%. Work-up prior to imaging should include: a 72-hour \nfast with serial glucose and insulin levels over this period until the patient becomes symptomatic. An \ninsulin/glucose ration of greater than 0.3 has been found in virtually all patients with insulinoma or other \nislet cell disease.53 \n\nPage 10 of 17 \nAbdomen CT \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc\n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\nPage 11 of 17 \nAbdomen CT \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\nHigh risk characteristics for mucinous pancreatic cysts include all of the following: Symptoms, Jaundice \nsecondary to the cyst, acute pancreatitis secondary to the cyst, elevated serum CA 19-9 and no benign \ncause present, an enhancing mural nodule or solid component within the cyst or pancreas, main \npancreatic duct of > 5mm, change in duct caliber with upstream atrophy, size over 3 cm, high grade \ndysplasia or cancer on cytology. These patients should undergo EUS + -FNA or be referred to a \nmultidisciplinary group for further recommendations.54  \n\nCT and elevated Liver Function Tests - For elevated bilirubin, or serum transaminases with or without \nbilirubin elevation, US is the initial recommended test to assess for duct dilatation which might lead to \nERCP or MRCP, vs other causes which might necessitate further lab testing or liver biopsy.55 \n\nCombination request of Abdomen CT/Chest CT - A chest CT will produce images to the level of L3. \nDocumentation for combo is required.   \n\nImaging of hernias - Most hernias are diagnosed clinically with imaging recommended for the \ndiagnosis of occult hernias or in the evaluation of hernia complications, such as bowel obstruction or \nstrangulation. To detect occult hernias, ultrasound is a first-line study with a sensitivity of 86% and \nspecificity of 77%, compared to 80% sensitivity and 65% specificity for CT.56 According to Miller, et al \n\u201cMagnetic resonance imaging is generally not considered a first- or even second-line evaluation \nmodality for hernias\u2026.\u201d57 Based on this analysis, MRI is recommended only when ultrasound and CT \nhave been performed and fail to make a diagnosis.  \n\n\n\nPage 12 of 17 \nAbdomen CT \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

Guideline 069 for Abdomen Pelvis CTA \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nCTA \nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) generates images of the arteries that can be \nevaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms with the use of ionizing \nradiation, which is a potential hazard in patients with impaired renal function. \n\nSpecial Note \nWhen vascular imaging of the aorta and both legs is desired (sometimes incorrectly \nrequested as Abdomen and Pelvis CTA & Lower Extremity CTA), only one authorization \nrequest is required, using CPT Code 75635 CT Angiography, Abdominal Aorta with Lower \nExtremity Runoff.

Aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta is defined as diameter \u2265 3.0 cm or \ndilatation of the aorta \u2265 1.5x the normal diameter. Evaluation of AAA can be accurately made \nby ultrasound which can detect and size AAA with the advantage of being relatively \ninexpensive, noninvasive, and not requiring iodinated contrast. The limitations are overlying \nbowel gas which can obscure findings and the technique is operator dependent. Ultrasound \nis used to screen for and to monitor aneurysms*. CT is used when US is inconclusive or \ninsufficient. When there are suspected complications, complex anatomy and/or surgery is \nplanned, CTA/MRA is preferred. \n  \nRisk factors for AAA include smoking history, age, male gender, family history of AAA (first \ndegree relative) and personal history of vascular disease. Risk factors for rupture include \nfemale gender, large initial aneurysm diameter, low FEV, current smoking history, elevated \nmean blood pressure and patients on immunosuppression after major organ transplantation. \nThe Society of Vascular Surgery recommends elective repair of AAA \u2265 5.5 cm in patients at \nlow or acceptable surgical risk.

Surveillance is extrapolated from AAA surveillance and can be done by CTA if \nultrasound is not successful. (10) \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester). \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds weight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Aortic Revised: separated out aortic syndromes to be more \n\nclear  \n\u25cf Added Genetic Syndromes and Tumors Section  \n\u25cf Statement put for contraindications and preferred studies; put \n\nin indications and background sections  \n\u25cf Combo section adjusted and made uniform  \n\u25cf Updated references and background sections  \n\nMarch 2023 \u25cf Aneurysm: specified guidance on initial imaging and \nscreening intervals with emphasis on requiring ultrasound on \ninitial imaging and indications for advanced imaging, specified \nguidance on post-repair imaging \n\n\u25cf Other vascular abnormalities: clarified indication for non-aortic \nvascular conditions  \n\n\u25cf Transplant: added section \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 11 of 13 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 069 for Abdomen Pelvis CTA \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of \nindeterminate findings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf Aligned sections across body imaging guidelines \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval  \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

034-1 for Abdomen CTA (Angiography) \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nCTA \nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) generates images of the arteries that can be \nevaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms. It is used to evaluate the \narteries of the abdominal aorta and the renal arteries.  CTA uses ionizing radiation and \nrequires the administration of iodinated contrast agent, which is a potential hazard in patients \nwith impaired renal function. Abdominal CTA is not used as a screening tool, e.g., evaluation \nof asymptomatic patients without a previous diagnosis. \n\nNOTE: Authorization for MR Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging. The term \nangiography refers to both arteriography and venography. \n\nSpecial Note \nFor conditions where both abdomen and pelvis imaging are needed and/or the disease \nprocess is reasonably expected to involve both the abdomen and pelvis, requests should be \nresubmitted as Abdomen and Pelvis CTA (CPT 74174). See Evolent Clinical Guideline 069 \nfor Abdomen/Pelvis CTA for coverage indications. \n\nWhen vascular imaging of the aorta and both legs with Runoff is desired (sometimes \nincorrectly requested as Abd/Pelvis CTA & Lower Extremity CTA), only one authorization \nrequest is required, using CPT Code 75635 (CT Angiography, Abdominal Aorta with Lower \nExtremity Runoff). This study provides for imaging of the abdomen, pelvis, and both legs.  \nSee Evolent Clinical Guideline 035 for Abdominal Aorta CT Angiography with Lower \nExtremity Runoff for coverage indications. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 13 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 034-1 for Abdomen CTA (Angiography) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR ABDOMEN CT \nANGIOGRAPHY/CT VENOGRAPHY (CTA/CTV) \nAbdominal Aortic Disease \nAbdominal Aortic Aneurysm \nAsymptomatic known or suspected abdominal aortic aneurysms when prior ultrasound is \ninconclusive or insufficient AND a reason CTA is needed rather than CT has been provided, \nsuch as complex vascular anatomy or suspected complications. \n\n\u25cf Symptomatic known or suspected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (1,2) \n\n\u25cb Symptoms may include: \n\n\u25a0 Abrupt onset of severe sharp or stabbing pain in the chest, back or abdomen \n\n\u25a0  Acute abdominal or back pain with a pulsatile or epigastric mass \n\n\u25a0 Acute abdominal or back pain and at high risk for aortic aneurysm and/or \naortic syndrome (risk factors include hypertension, atherosclerosis, prior \ncardiac or aortic surgery, underlying aneurysm, connective tissue disorder \n(e.g., Marfan syndrome, vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-\nDietz syndrome), and bicuspid aortic valve (3) \n\nAortic Syndromes \n\u25cf For initial diagnosis of suspected and follow-up of known aortic syndromes, including \n\naortic dissection, intramural hematoma and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. \n\n\u25cf Frequency for follow up is as clinically indicated \n\nPostoperative Follow-Up of Aortic Repair \nFollow-up for post-endovascular repair (EVAR) or open repair of AAA (1) or abdominal extent \nof iliac artery aneurysms at the following intervals (CT preferred for routine follow up): \n\n\u25cf Routine, baseline post-EVAR study when a reason CTA rather than CT is needed \nhas been provided such as complex anatomy or suspected complications: \n\n\u25cb Within one month of procedure \n\n\u25cb Continued follow up imaging at the following intervals: \n\n\u25a0 If no endoleak or sac enlargement is seen: \n\n\u25a1 Annually monitor with ultrasound \n\n\uf0bf When US is abnormal or insufficient CT/MR can be using to monitor \nannually \n\n\u25a1 Every 5 years monitor with CT/MR \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 13 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 034-1 for Abdomen CTA (Angiography) \n\n\u25a0 If type II endoleak or sac enlargement is seen at any point in time (US not \nneeded): \n\n\u25a1 Monitor every 6 months x 2 years, then annually (does not require US) \n\n\u25cf Routine follow up after open repair of AAA when a reason CTA is needed rather than \nCT has been provided such as complex vascular anatomy or suspected \ncomplications:(2) \n\n\u25cb Within 1 year postoperatively then \n\n\u25cb Annually monitor with ultrasound \n\n\u25a0 When US is abnormal or insufficient CT/MR can be used to monitor annually \n\n\u25cb Every 5 years monitor with CT/MR \n\n\u25cf If symptomatic or imaging shows increasing or new findings related to stent graft \u2013 \nmore frequent imaging may be needed as clinically indicated \n\n\u25cf Suspected complications such as: new onset lower extremity claudication, ischemia, \nor reduction in ABI after aneurysm repair. \n\nRenal Artery Stenosis \nIn a patient with hypertension unrelated to recent medication use AND prior abnormal or \ninconclusive ultrasound AND any of the following: (4,5,6) \n\n\u25cf Onset of hypertension prior to the age of 30 without a family history of hypertension \nand when there is suspicion of fibromuscular dysplasia or a vasculitis \n\n\u25cf Failure to obtain adequate blood pressure control on 3 antihypertensive medications, \nincluding one diuretic \n\n\u25cf Recurrent episodes of sudden onset of congestive heart failure (also known as \ncardiac disturbance syndrome;

Aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta is defined as diameter \u2265 3.0 cm or \ndilatation of the aorta \u2265 1.5x the normal diameter. Ultrasound can detect and size AAA, with \nthe advantage of being relatively inexpensive, noninvasive, and not requiring iodinate \ncontrast. CT is used when US is inconclusive or insufficient. When there are suspected \ncomplications, complex anatomy and/or surgery is planned, CTA/MRA is preferred. \n \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 10 of 13 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 034-1 for Abdomen CTA (Angiography) \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \n June 2024 \u25cf Separated out aortic syndromes to be more clear  \n\n\u25cf EVAR studies clarified order of which studies would be \nordered  \n\n\u25cf Renal artery stenosis: updated per new clinical guidance  \n\u25cf Added Genetic Syndromes and Tumors Section  \n\u25cf Statement put in all Guidelines for contraindications put in \n\nindications and background sections  \n\u25cf Combo section adjusted and made uniform  \n\u25cf Updated references and background section \n\nMarch 2023 \u25cf Redirected vascular requests for abdomen alone or pelvis \nimaging alone to resubmit as abdomen and pelvis CTA \nrequired unless condition limited to abdomen \n\n\u25cf Other vascular abnormalities: clarified indication for non-aortic \nvascular conditions        \n\n\u25cf Transplant: added section \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of indeterminate \nfindings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf Aligned sections across body imaging guidelines \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval  \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

Lastly, with a negative CXR, \nonly when initial workup and abdomen/pelvis CT/MR fail to identify the cause for fever can \nChest CT be approved. If CXR suggests a malignancy and/or source of fever, then Chest CT \nwould be approved. \n\nParaneoplastic Syndromes \nSuspected paraneoplastic syndromes with no established cancer diagnosis: laboratory \nevaluation and imaging. \n\nThe laboratory evaluation for paraneoplastic syndrome is complex. If the appropriate lab test \nresults are suspicious for malignancy, imaging is indicated. \n\nFor SIADH (hyponatremia + increased urine osmolality), there is a high association with \nsmall cell lung cancer, therefore imaging typically starts with chest CT. If other symptoms \nsuggest a different diagnosis other than small cell lung cancer, different imaging studies may \nbe reasonable. \n\nFor hypercalcemia (high serum calcium, low-normal PTH, high PTHrP) it is reasonable to \nstart with bone imaging followed by a more directed evaluation such as mammogram, chest, \nabdomen, and pelvis imaging as appropriate. \n\nFor Cushing syndrome (hypokalemia, normal-high midnight serum ACTH NOT suppressed \nwith dexamethasone) abdominal and chest imaging is reasonable. If dexamethasone \nsuppression test DOES suppress ACTH, pituitary MRI is reasonable. \n\nFor hypoglycemia, labs drawn during a period of hypoglycemia (glucose < 55, typically a 72 \nhour fast) (insulin level, C-peptide, and IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio) should be done to evaluate for an \ninsulinoma. An elevated insulin level, elevated C-peptide and/or normal IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio \nwarrant CT or MRI abdomen to look for insulinoma. A low insulin, low C-peptide and/or \nelevated IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio warrant chest and abdominal imaging. \n\nWhen a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome is suspected, nuclear and cytoplasmic antibody \npanels are often ordered to further identify specific tumor types. Results are needed prior to \nimaging. Because these tests are highly specific, if an antibody highly associated with a \nspecific cancer is positive, then further imaging for that cancer is reasonable. For example, \nanti-Hu has a high association with SCLC and chest CT would be reasonable. Anti-MA2 has \na high association with testicular cancer and testicular ultrasound would be a reasonable \nnext step. \n\nWeight Loss \nUnintentional weight loss is considered clinically significant if the amount of weight lost over \n12 months is \u2265 5%. Older age and higher percentage of weight loss correlates with higher \nlikelihood of malignancy. A targeted evaluation is recommended when there are signs or \nsymptoms suggestive of a specific source. For example, when there is clinically significant \nweight loss with abdominal pain that prompts an evaluation for an abdominal source of the \nweight loss; CXR and labs such as TSH would not be needed prior to abdominal imaging. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 18 of 23 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 068 for Abdomen Pelvis CT \n\nConversely a smoker with a cough and weight loss would not start with abdominal imaging, \na chest x-ray (CXR) would be the first test to start with. When there is no suspected \ndiagnosis, initial evaluation includes CXR, age-appropriate cancer screening (such as \ncolonoscopy and mammography) and labs (including CBC, CMP, HbA1C, TSH, stool \nhemoccult, ESR/CRP, HIV, Hepatitis C). If this initial evaluation fails to identify a cause of \nweight loss, then the patient is monitored and if progressive weight loss is seen on \nsubsequent visits/weights, then CT Abdomen/Pelvis is reasonable (MRI if there is a \ncontraindication to CT such as contrast allergy or impaired renal function). Lastly, with a \nnegative CXR, only when initial workup and abdomen/pelvis CT/MR fail to identify the cause \nfor weight loss can Chest CT be approved. If CXR suggests a malignancy and/or source of \nweight loss, then Chest CT would be approved. \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds weight limit/dimensions of MRI machine \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Combination studies section adjusted to make uniform with all \n\nother guidelines \n\u25cf Added Genetic Syndromes and Tumors Section \n\u25cf Added contraindications and preferred studies section \n\u25cf Moved sections/indications throughout for better indications \n\ngrouping  \n\u25cf Updated references and background \n\nMarch 2023 \u25cf Prostate cancer: updated guidance based on new NCCN \ncriteria \n\n\u25cf IBD: clarified indications \n\u25cf Pancreas: specified guidance on pancreatitis \n\u25cf Pyelonephritis: clarified risk factors and indications \n\u25cf Aneurysm: specified guidance on initial imaging and \n\nscreening intervals with emphasis on requiring ultrasound on \ninitial imaging and indications for advanced imaging, specified \nguidance on post-repair imaging \n\n\u25cf Hernia: clarified hernia types and indicated studies \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 19 of 23 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 068 for Abdomen Pelvis CT \n\n\u25cf Transplant: added section \n\u25cf Other: specified guidance for weight loss, paraneoplastic \n\nsyndrome, edema; added indications for thrombocytopenia, \ngestational trophoblastic disease, cancer predisposition \nsyndromes \n\n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of \nindeterminate findings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf Aligned sections across body imaging guidelines \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

Abdomen/pelvis imaging begins at the diaphragmatic \ndome through pubic symphysis. CT uses x-rays and multiple detectors to create cross-sectional images \nof the normal anatomy as well as demonstrate abnormal soft tissue densities, calcifications or fluid/gas \npatterns in the viscera or peritoneal space. \n\nIn general, ionizing radiation from CT should be avoided during pregnancy. Ultrasound is clearly a safer \nimaging option and is the first imaging test of choice; although, CT or MRI after equivocal ultrasound \nhas been validated for diagnosis. Clinicians should exercise increased caution with CT imaging in \nchildren, pregnant women, and young adults due to the risks of exposure to ionizing radiation. \nScreening for pregnancy as part of a work-up is suggested to minimize the number of unexpected \nradiation exposures for women of childbearing age.  \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nCT Imaging for renal colic and hematuria \n\nMore than 2 million emergency visits in the US are for suspected renal colic, and CT is performed in \nover 90% of patients diagnosed with kidney stones.73 Evidence now supports ultrasound or no further \nimaging in specific clinical scenarios as renal colic is often self-limited. CT can guide therapy in a subset \nof patients who require intervention or who have other conditions that mimic renal colic (i.e., \nappendicitis).  CT protocols include: \u201cstone protocol\u201d for detecting urinary tract calculi, \u201crenal mass \nprotocol\u201d for characterizing known renal masses, and CT urography for evaluating hematuria. Non-\ncontrast CT can be used for detecting most ureteral and renal stones but sometimes an intravenous \ncontrast agent is needed to determine the relationship of the calculus to the opacified ureter. \n\nPage 10 of 22 \nAbdomen Pelvis CT Combo \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc\n \u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\nCT imaging for recurrent urinary tract infections \n\nImaging in patients without risk factors and less than two infections a year on average and who \nrespond promptly to therapy, is of low yield. Risk factors include but are not limited to: Infection with \nurea-splitting organism, previous pyelonephritis, history of calculi or obstruction, obstructive \nsymptoms, elevated creatinine, severe diabetes, childhood UTI, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, \nhistory of GU surgery, suspected bladder diverticula or urethral, urinary incontinence, pelvic floor \ndysfunction, post void residual.74 \n\nCT Imaging for abdominal aortic aneurysms  \n\nNOTE: For known or suspected abdominal aneurysm, CT/MRI should not be approvable without a \ncontraindication to CTAngiography /MRAngiography, such as severe renal dysfunction, contrast allergy, \nor another specific reason CT/MRI (rather than CTA/MRA) is preferred.  \n\nIf a pulsatile abdominal mass is found in an asymptomatic patient, abdominal ultrasonography is an \ninexpensive and noninvasive technique for initial evaluation. For further examination, CT may be \nperformed to better define the shape and extent of the aneurysm and the local anatomic relationships \nof the visceral and renal vessels. CT has high level of accuracy in sizing aneurysms; however, CTA and \nMRA are the gold standards for imaging.  The majority of evidence regarding AAA surveillance using CT \nis based on CTA data and is primarily related to contrast bolus timing. Contrast-enhanced CT is well \nestablished in the literature and is capable of identifying aortic aneurysms, with many papers \ndiscussing incidental AAA identification.75, 76 Risk of rupture in 6 years for an AAA < 4 cm is 1%.  For a 4-\n5 cm AAA, the risk of rupture increases to 1-3% per year and becomes 6-11% per year for AAA 5-7 cm \nin cross sectional diameter.  For any AAA >7 cm, the risk of rupture goes to 7% per year. \n\nInitial evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) \n\nInitial evaluation of AAA is accurately made by ultrasound.  \n\n**Abdominal aneurysms and general guidelines for follow-up \n\nThe normal diameter of the suprarenal abdominal aorta is 3.0 cm and that of the infrarenal is 2.0 cm.  \nAneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta is defined as diameter \u2265 3.0 cm or dilatation of the aorta \n\u2265 1.5x the normal diameter. Ultrasound can detect and size AAA, with the advantage of being relatively \ninexpensive, noninvasive, and not require iodinate contrast. The limitations are that overlying bowel \ngas can obscure findings and the technique is operator dependent. Ultrasound is used to screen for \nand to monitor aneurysms*. CT is used when US is inconclusive or insufficient. When there are \nsuspected complications, complex anatomy and/or surgery is planned, CTA/MRA is preferred.  Risk \nfactors for AAA include smoking history, age, male gender, family history of AAA (first degree relative) \nand personal history of vascular disease. Risk factors for rupture include female gender, large initial \naneurysm diameter, low FEV, current smoking history, elevated mean blood pressure and patients on \nimmunosuppression after major organ transplantation. The Society of Vascular Surgery recommends \nelective repair of AAA \u2265 5.5 cm in patients at low or acceptable surgical risk. 1 \n\nPage 11 of 22 \nAbdomen Pelvis CT Combo \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\nUltrasound screening intervals*: \n\no Aneurysm size 2.5\u20133 cm, every 10 years\no Aneurysm size 3.0\u20133.9 cm, every 3 years\no Aneurysm size 4.0-4.9 cm, annually77\n\no Aneurysm size 5.0-5.4 cm, every 6 months\n\nCT for Mesenteric Ischemia \n\nCT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast performed during the venous phase has \nbeen less well-studied compared with CTA in diagnosing mesenteric ischemia. CT with IV contrast can \nassess nonvascular findings, major arterial lesions, and mesenteric veins; however, the lack of arterial \nphase may lead to suboptimal evaluation of the mesenteric arteries compared to CTA.46 \n\nCT for elevation of CEA with no history of a previous CEA-producing tumor \n\nCEA is not normally elevated after birth, but elevated CEA levels increases the chance of finding colon \ncancer from 1.3% to 4.6%. It is also a predictor of other diseases, including other cancers (e.g., \nmucinous adenocarcinomas of the endocervix and ovary, as well as keratinising squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the cervix), diabetes, chronic lung, and liver disease. \n\nEvaluation should begin with a thorough history, including smoking history, and clinical exam. \nInvestigation would include repeat CEA, full blood count, iron, liver function and renal function tests, \nCA 125 levels, and calcitonin. If CEA <10ng/ml and clinical review is negative, repeat the clinical \nevaluation in 3 months and CEA for changes. If level falls, repeat at 6-month intervals until normal or 2 \nconsecutive decreases.  If CEA level remains above 5 ng/ml after 3-6-month intervals or exceeds \n10ng/ml at any stage, consider CT imaging.78 \n\nCT and Fever of Unknown Origin \n\nInitial work up prior to CT would include a comprehensive history, repeated physical exam, complete \nblood count with differential, three sets of blood cultures, chest x-ray, complete metabolic panel, \nurinalysis, ESR, ANA, RA, CMV IgM antibodies, virus detection in blood, heterophile antibody test, \ntuberculin test, and HIV antibody test.63 Lastly, with a negative CXR, only when initial workup and \nabdomen/pelvis CT/MR fail to identify the cause for fever can Chest CT be approved. If CXR suggests a \nmalignancy and/or source of fever, then Chest CT would be approved. \n\nSuspected paraneoplastic syndromes with no established cancer diagnosis: laboratory evaluation \nand imaging \n\nThe laboratory evaluation for paraneoplastic syndrome is complex. If the appropriate lab test results \nare suspicious for malignancy, imaging is indicated.  \n\nFor SIADH (hyponatremia + increased urine osmolality), there is a high association with small cell lung \ncancer, therefore imaging typically starts with chest CT. If other symptoms suggest a different diagnosis \nother than small cell lung cancer, different imaging studies may be reasonable.  \n\nPage 12 of 22 \nAbdomen Pelvis CT Combo \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\nFor hypercalcemia (high serum calcium, low-normal PTH, high PTHrP) it is reasonable to start with \nbone imaging followed by a more directed evaluation such as mammogram, chest, abdomen, and \npelvis imaging as appropriate.  \n\nFor Cushing syndrome (hypokalemia, normal-high midnight serum ACTH NOT suppressed with \ndexamethasone) abdominal and chest imaging is reasonable. If dexamethasone suppression test DOES \nsuppress ACTH, pituitary MRI is reasonable.  \n\nFor hypoglycemia, labs drawn during a period of hypoglycemia (glucose < 55, typically a 72 hour fast) \n(insulin level, C-peptide, and IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio) should be done to evaluate for an insulinoma. An \nelevated insulin level, elevated C-peptide and/or normal IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio warrant CT or MRI abdomen \nto look for insulinoma. A low insulin, low C-peptide and/or elevated IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio warrant chest \nand abdominal imaging.  \n\nWhen a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome is suspected, nuclear and cytoplasmic antibody panels are \noften ordered to further identify specific tumor types. Results are needed prior to imaging. Because \nthese tests are highly specific, if an antibody highly associated with a specific cancer is positive, then \nfurther imaging for that cancer is reasonable. For example, anti-Hu has a high association with SCLC \nand chest CT would be reasonable. Anti-MA2 has a high association with testicular cancer and \ntesticular ultrasound would be a reasonable next step.  \n\nWeight loss definitions and initial evaluation \n\nUnintentional weight loss is considered clinically significant55, 79 if the amount of weight lost over 12 \nmonths is \u2265 5%. Older age and higher percentage of weight loss correlates with higher likelihood of \nmalignancy. A targeted evaluation is recommended when there are signs or symptoms suggestive of a \nspecific source. For example, when there is clinically significant weight loss with abdominal pain that \nprompts an evaluation for an abdominal source of the weight loss; CXR and labs such as TSH would not \nbe needed prior to abdominal imaging. Conversely a smoker with a cough and weight loss would not \nstart with abdominal imaging, a chest x-ray (CXR) would be the first test to start with. When there is no \nsuspected diagnosis, initial evaluation includes CXR, age-appropriate cancer screening (such as \ncolonoscopy and mammography) and labs (including CBC, CMP, HbA1C, TSH, stool hemoccult, \nESR/CRP, HIV, Hepatitis C). If this initial evaluation fails to identify a cause of weight loss, then the \npatient is monitored and if progressive weight loss is seen on subsequent visits/weights, then CT \nAbdomen/Pelvis is reasonable (MRI if there is a contraindication to CT such as contrast allergy or \nimpaired renal function)80. Lastly, with a negative CXR, only when initial workup and abdomen/pelvis \nCT/MR fail to identify the cause for weight loss can Chest CT be approved. If CXR suggests a malignancy \nand/or source of weight loss, then Chest CT would be approved. \n\nCombination request of Abdomen CT/Chest CT \n\nA Chest CT will produce images to the level of L3.  Documentation for combo is required. \n\nEvaluation for appendicitis following clinical and laboratory evaluation \n\nPage 13 of 22 \nAbdomen Pelvis CT Combo \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\nSonography of the right upper quadrant and pelvis followed by graded compression and color Doppler \nsonography of the right lower quadrant was used by Gaitini and colleagues as the initial imaging study \nin 420 consecutive patients referred for emergency evaluation of acute appendicitis.  This method \ncorrectly diagnosed acute appendicitis in 66 of 75 patients (88%) and excluded it correctly in 312 of \n326 patients (96%).  It was inconclusive in 19 patients (<5%).  Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive \nvalue, negative predictive value and accuracy were 74.2%, 97%, 88%, 93%, and 92%, respectively and \ncomparable to CT.81 \n\nAppropriate and timely diagnosis of acute appendicitis is needed.  Negative laparotomy rates can range \nfrom 16% to 47% when based on clinical and laboratory data alone, while perforation rate can reach \n35% when surgery is delayed.  Appropriate initial imaging can lower the negative laparotomy rate to 6-\n10%.  Ultrasound has a higher non-diagnostic rate (4%) vs. 0.8% for MDCT.  In a prospective study \noperator experience and patient BMI did not affect diagnostic accuracy.81, 82 \n\nConsider alternatives to CT imaging in patients with Crohn disease \n\nIn facilities where the technical and clinical expertise exists, MR enterography is emerging as the study \nof choice (replacing CT) for patients requiring frequent follow-up examinations to determine disease \nextent or progression.  The technique also allows evaluation of extramucosal and extraluminal disease. \n\nConsider the role of capsule endoscopy \n\nSmall bowel capsule endoscopy allows for direct visualization of the mucosa of the small intestine and \nhas been found to be superior to barium studies, CTE and ileocolonscopy. However, the specificity has \nbeen questioned. There is a high negative predictive value of 96%.  Also, it may identify a site for \nselected biopsy to establish a diagnosis.  \n\nLab tests used in diagnosing IBD \n\nAnti-glycan antibodies are more prevalent in CD than UC, but this test has a low sensitivity. Fecal \ncalprotectin is a helpful test that can help differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome as well as in \nassessment of disease activity, including response to therapy. Data supports the use of fecal \ncalprotectin to predict relapse in CD. Those who relapsed in one year had significantly higher levels at \nbaseline. Fecal lactoferrin and fecal PMN-elastase are also used for monitoring disease activity in \nCrohn\u2019s.83 \n\nImaging of hernias \n\nMost hernias are diagnosed clinically with imaging recommended for the diagnosis of occult hernias or \nin the evaluation of hernia complications, such as bowel obstruction or strangulation. To detect occult \nhernias, ultrasound is a first-line study with a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 77%, compared to \n80% sensitivity and 65% specificity for CT.84 According to Miller, et al \u201cMagnetic resonance imaging is \ngenerally not considered a first- or even second-line evaluation modality for hernias\u2026.\u201d85 Based on this \nanalysis, MRI is recommended only when ultrasound and CT have been performed and fail to make a \ndiagnosis.   \n\nPage 14 of 22 \nAbdomen Pelvis CT Combo \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\nPage 15 of 22 \nAbdomen Pelvis CT Combo \n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc \n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

Guideline 031 for Abdomen MRI, MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography), \n\nMRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography), and MRU (Magnetic Resonance Urography) \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nAbdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) generates images of the organs and \nstructures within the abdomen without the use of ionizing radiation. \n\nSpecial Note \nA single authorization for CPT codes 74181, 74182, 74183, S8037 covers imaging of the \nbiliary tree and its attached organs, i.e., the liver, gallbladder (GB), and pancreas. These \nsame codes also cover MRI abdomen, Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE), and \nMagnetic Resonance Urography (MRU). Multiple authorizations are not typically required. \nWhen both Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and MRI abdomen are \nrequested, documentation requires a medical reason clearly indicating why both are needed, \ni.e., that meets guidelines for imaging of bowel, kidneys, or areas other than liver, pancreas, \nGB, and biliary tree as well. \n \nNote: There are no MRI Abdomen/Pelvis combo (comparable to a CT Abdomen/Pelvis) such \nthat if imaging of both the abdomen and pelvis are indicated, two separate exams (and \nauthorization) are required (i.e., MRI Abdomen and MRI Pelvis) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR ABDOMEN MRI \nOrgan Specific Imaging \nAdrenal (1) \n\n\u25cf Indeterminate adrenal lesion seen on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf For further evaluation of suspected adrenal tumors and/or endocrine disorders when \nthere is clinical and laboratory evidence to suggest an adrenal source; see \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 24 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 031 for Abdomen MRI, MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography), \n\nMRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography), and MRU (Magnetic Resonance Urography) \n\nBackground for specific laboratory testing that is needed based on suspected \ndiagnosis(2) \n\n\u25cf Adrenal mass < 4 cm incidentally discovered with benign characteristics \n(homogenous, regular borders, HU < 10), one follow-up at 6 months then annually x \n2 years (no further imaging if stable) \n\n\u25cf Adrenal mass \u2265 4 cm and no diagnosis of cancer, can approve for either pre-\noperative planning OR if surgery is not done, can repeat imaging in 6-12 months then \nas clinically indicated (if there is known malignancy, biopsy is typically the next step \nrather than surveillance imaging) \n\n\u25cf For follow up of known adrenal mass when a change in tumor is suspected by either \nimaging, laboratory evaluation and/or symptoms \n\n\u25cf See Genetic Syndromes and Rare Diseases for additional screening indications \n\nLiver \n\u25cf Indeterminate liver lesion seen on prior imaging(3) \n\n\u25cf Rising AFP (requires a \u22657 ng/mL increased in AFP per month) in patients at high risk \nfor HCC (known cirrhosis and/or chronic hepatitis B, see Background for additional \nrisk categories)(4) \n\n\u25cf Screening in patients at high risk for HCC (see above) every 6 months when prior \nultrasound is insufficient to evaluate the liver due to steatosis/fatty liver or nodular \nliver \n\n\u25cb The finding of steatosis/fatty liver and/or nodular liver alone on an ultrasound \nreport is insufficient for approval; the report must specify that those findings \nprevent adequate visualization of the liver by ultrasound \n\n\u25cf Jaundice or abnormal liver function tests after equivocal or abnormal ultrasound (5,6) \n\n\u25cf Follow-up of suspected hepatocellular adenomas every 6 months for 2 years, then \nannually (sooner if change was noted on last imaging study)(7,8) \n\n\u25cf Surveillance of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, every 6 months after the \nage of 20 (MRI and MRCP preferred over CT)(9) \n\n\u25cf Follow-up of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), repeat imaging in 6-12 months to \nensure stability.

The following list describes suspected syndrome/tumor and \ntypical laboratory evaluation in parenthesis: \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 15 of 24 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 031 for Abdomen MRI, MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography), \n\nMRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography), and MRU (Magnetic Resonance Urography) \n\n \nGI Carcinoid (24-hour urine or plasma 5-HIAA), Lung/Thymus Carcinoid (24-hour urine or \nplasma 5-HIAA and one of the following: overnight dexamethasone suppression test, 2-3 \nmidnight salivary cortisols, 24-hour urinary free cortisol), PPoma (serum pancreatic \npolypeptide), Insulinoma (serum insulin, pro-insulin and C-peptide all drawn during a period \nof hypoglycemia (i.e. 72 hour fast)), VIPoma (serum VIP), glucagonoma (serum glucagon), \ngastrinoma (serum gastrin), somatostatinoma (serum somatostatin), \npheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (plasma free or 24-hour urine fractionated \nmetanephrines and normetanephrines +/- serum or urine catecholamines), pituitary tumor \n(serum IGF-1, prolactin, LH/FSH, alpha subunits, TSH and one of the following: overnight \ndexamethasone suppression test, 2-3 midnight salivary cortisols, 24-hour urinary free \ncortisol), primary hyperaldosteronism (suppressed renin/renin activity in association with \nelevated plasma aldosterone (>10 ng/dL) and confirmatory testing if positive), adrenocortical \ncarcinoma (testosterone, DHEA-S and complete evaluation for hypercortisolemia or primary \naldosteronism)(54) \n \nIf Cushing\u2019s (hypercortisolemia) is suspected, typical labs include a plasma ACTH and one \nor more of the following: overnight dexamethasone suppression test, 2-3 midnight salivary \ncortisols, or 24-hour urinary free cortisol. The results of the suppression test then indicate \nwhether brain imaging is needed (pituitary source) or chest and abdominal imaging is \nneeded (CXR + Adrenal CT/MRI). ACTH > 20 after suppression > 20 is suggestive of \nCushing\u2019s Disease and Pituitary MRI +/- CXR is indicated. ACTH after suppression < 5 is \nsuggestive of Cushing\u2019s Syndrome and CXR + Adrenal CT/MRI is indicated.(58) If \nindeterminate, a CRH or desmopressin test is then done. If there is no ACTH suppression \nwith CRH/desmopressin, then adrenal imaging is indicated.(59) \n\nLiver \nMRI of the Liver \nThe liver is a common site of metastatic spread. Patients with a history of known or \nsuspected malignancy, especially tumors from the colon, lung, pancreas, and stomach, are \nat risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease are also \nat risk for developing liver cancer and undergo periodic liver screening for focal liver lesion \ndetection, usually with ultrasonography (US). Liver-specific contrast agents (gadobenate \ndimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA, MultiHance) and gadoxetate disodium (Eovist) are taken up by \nfunctionally intact hepatocytes, allowing increased visualization of both tumors and liver \nmetastases. As metastatic liver lesions do not take up these contrast agents, a dedicated \nliver MRI can help identify tumors as it allows more contrast differentiation between the \ntumor and normal liver tissue. In patients undergoing PET scans for active malignancies and \nthere are either known liver metastases in need of restaging or indeterminate liver lesions on \nother imaging (such as PET or CT), a dedicated liver MRI is considered complimentary NOT \noverlapping and can be approved in addition to PET if the patient otherwise meets criteria for \nPET approval (see PET Guideline for further guidance). \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 16 of 24 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 031 for Abdomen MRI, MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography), \n\nMRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography), and MRU (Magnetic Resonance Urography) \n\nScreening for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) \nAASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) recommends screening for \nHCC with ultrasound every 6 months for patients with hepatitis C and B. Advanced imaging \nis recommended when the AFP is rising, regardless of ultrasound results. The main risk \nfactors for HCC are cirrhosis and Hepatitis B. Additional populations for which there is a \nbenefit to surveillance for HCC include: Asian males Hepatitis B carriers \u2265 40 y, Asian \nfemale Hepatitis B carriers \u226550 y, Hepatitis B carriers with + family history of HCC and \nAfrican and/or North American blacks with hepatitis B.(4,7) \n\nKidney \nPRO-PKD Score (22,60) \nThe PRO-PDK score is to assess prognosis in ADPKD, risk scoring system is on the basis of \nPKD mutation and clinical parameters. \n\nRisk Category Points \n\nBeing Male 1  \n\nHypertension before 35 years of age 2  \n\nFirst Urological event (macroscopic hematuria, flank pain or cyst infection) \nbefore 35 years of age \n\n2 \n\nPKD2 mutation 0 \n\nNon-truncating PKD1 mutation 2 \n\nTruncating PKD1 mutation 4 \n\nA score of > 6 predicts rapid disease progression with ESRD onset before the age of \n60 years with a positive predictive value of 90.0% \n\nFor those with an intermediate score (4-6 points), the prognosis is unclear \n\nFever of Unknown Origin \nInitial work up prior to CT/MRI would include a comprehensive history, repeated physical \nexam, complete blood count with differential, three sets of blood cultures, chest x-ray, \ncomplete metabolic panel, urinalysis, ESR, ANA, RA, CMV IgM antibodies, virus detection in \nblood, heterophile antibody test, tuberculin test, and HIV antibody test.(61) Lastly, with a \nnegative CXR, only when initial workup and abdomen/pelvis CT/MR fail to identify the cause \nfor fever can Chest CT be approved. If CXR suggests a malignancy and/or source of fever, \nthen Chest CT would be approved. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 17 of 24 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 031 for Abdomen MRI, MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography), \n\nMRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography), and MRU (Magnetic Resonance Urography) \n\nParaneoplastic Syndromes \nSuspected paraneoplastic syndromes with no established cancer diagnosis: laboratory \nevaluation and imaging \n \nThe laboratory evaluation for paraneoplastic syndrome is complex. If the appropriate lab test \nresults are suspicious for malignancy, imaging is indicated. \n \nFor SIADH (hyponatremia + increased urine osmolality), there is a high association with \nsmall cell lung cancer, therefore imaging typically starts with chest CT. If other symptoms \nsuggest a different diagnosis other than small cell lung cancer, different imaging studies may \nbe reasonable. \n \nFor hypercalcemia (high serum calcium, low-normal PTH, high PTHrP) it is reasonable to \nstart with bone imaging followed by a more directed evaluation such as mammogram, chest, \nabdomen, and pelvis imaging as appropriate. \n \nFor Cushing syndrome (hypokalemia, normal-high midnight serum ACTH not suppressed \nwith dexamethasone) abdominal and chest imaging is reasonable. If dexamethasone \nsuppression test does suppress ACTH, pituitary MRI is reasonable. \n \nFor hypoglycemia, labs drawn during a period of hypoglycemia (glucose < 55, typically a 72 \nhour fast) (insulin level, C-peptide, and IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio) should be done to evaluate for an \ninsulinoma. An elevated insulin level, elevated C-peptide and/or normal IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio \nwarrants CT or MRI abdomen to look for insulinoma. A low insulin, low C-peptide and/or \nelevated IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio warrants chest and abdominal imaging. \n \nWhen a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome is suspected, nuclear and cytoplasmic antibody \npanels are often ordered to further identify specific tumor types. Results are needed prior to \nimaging. Because these tests are highly specific, if an antibody highly associated with a \nspecific cancer is positive, then further imaging for that cancer is reasonable. For example, \nanti-Hu has a high association with SCLC and chest CT would be reasonable. Anti-MA2 has \na high association with testicular cancer and testicular ultrasound would be a reasonable \nnext step. \n\nWeight Loss \nUnintentional weight loss is considered clinically significant if the amount of weight lost over \n12 months is \u2265 5%. Older age and higher percentage of weight loss correlates with higher \nlikelihood of malignancy. A targeted evaluation is recommended when there are signs or \nsymptoms suggestive of a specific source. For example, when there is clinically significant \nweight loss with abdominal pain that prompts an evaluation for an abdominal source of the \nweight loss; CXR and labs such as TSH would not be needed prior to abdominal imaging. \nConversely a smoker with a cough and weight loss would not start with abdominal imaging, \na chest x-ray (CXR) would be the first test to start with. When there is no suspected \ndiagnosis, initial evaluation includes CXR, age-appropriate cancer screening (such as \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 18 of 24 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 031 for Abdomen MRI, MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography), \n\nMRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography), and MRU (Magnetic Resonance Urography) \n\ncolonoscopy and mammography) and labs (including CBC, CMP, HbA1C, TSH, stool \nhemoccult, ESR/CRP, HIV, Hepatitis C). If this initial evaluation fails to identify a cause of \nweight loss, then the patient is monitored and if progressive weight loss is seen on \nsubsequent visits/weights, then CT Abdomen/Pelvis is reasonable (MRI if there is a \ncontraindication to CT such as contrast allergy or impaired renal function). Lastly, with a \nnegative CXR, only when initial workup and abdomen/pelvis CT/MR fail to identify the cause \nfor weight loss can Chest CT be approved. If CXR suggests a malignancy and/or source of \nweight loss, then Chest CT would be approved. \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Revised the purpose  \n\n\u25cf Genetics section and Malignancy was reorganized  \n\u25cf Organ section was reorganized  \n\u25cf Fixed typo in pancreas section for mm to be cm  \n\u25cf Renal Bosniak section was adjusted to incorporate \n\nbackground into this section for further clarification  \n\u25cf Polycystic Kidney Disease was updated  \n\u25cf Known Malignancy section was adjusted to indicate initial \n\nstaging, restaging, and surveillance to be consistent with new \ncancer bundles coming out  \n\n\u25cf Background cut  \n\u25cf Added in post-embolization imaging \n\u25cf Added CPT code +0722T \n\u25cf Added Contraindications and Preferred Studies statement to \n\nBackground \n\u25cf Adjusted Combination Studies \n\nMay 2023 \u25cf IBD: eliminated indications for abdomen alone or pelvis \nimaging alone, resubmission as abdomen and pelvis CT \nrequired unless limited indication \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 19 of 24 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 031 for Abdomen MRI, MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography), \n\nMRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography), and MRU (Magnetic Resonance Urography) \n\n\u25cf Adrenal: additional guidance provided for imaging intervals \nand background given for functional tumors \n\n\u25cf Liver: clarified guidance for HCC surveillance imaging, follow \nup of specific conditions such as hepatic steatosis and focal \nnodular hyperplasia \n\n\u25cf Pancreas: updated pancreatic cystic lesion guidance, \nspecified guidance for increased lifetime risk for pancreatic \ncancer and pancreatitis \n\n\u25cf Renal: specified guidance for increased lifetime risk of renal \ncancer \n\n\u25cf Hernia: Added indications for lower esophageal and deep \nintraabdominal hernias \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm: eliminated indications for abdomen alone or pelvis \nimaging alone, resubmission as abdomen and pelvis CT \nrequired unless limited indication \n\n\u25cf Transplant: added section \n\u25cf Background: deleted some sections, added information to \n\nassist with adjudication/application of guideline statement \n\u25cf Aligned sections across body imaging guidelines \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of indeterminate \nfindings on prior imaging \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

Guideline 034-2 for Abdomen MRA/MRV (Angiography) \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and (MRV) generates images of the blood vessels \nthat can be evaluated for evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms without use of \nionizing radiation. It is used to evaluate the blood vessels of the abdomen. \n\nNOTE: Authorization for MR Angiography covers both arterial and venous imaging.

Aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta is defined as diameter \u2265 3.0 cm or \ndilatation of the aorta \u2265 1.5x the normal diameter.(41) Evaluation of AAA can be accurately \nmade by ultrasound which can detect and size AAA with the advantage of being relatively \ninexpensive, noninvasive, and not requiring iodinated contrast. The limitations are overlying \nbowel gas which can obscure findings and the technique is operator dependent. Ultrasound \nis used to screen for and to monitor aneurysms*. CT is used when US is inconclusive or \ninsufficient. When there are suspected complications, complex anatomy and/or surgery is \nplanned, CTA/MRA is preferred.  \n\nRisk factors for AAA include smoking history, age, male gender, family history of AAA (first \ndegree relative) and personal history of vascular disease. Risk factors for rupture include \nfemale gender, large initial aneurysm diameter, low FEV, current smoking history, elevated \nmean blood pressure and patients on immunosuppression after major organ transplantation. \nThe Society of Vascular Surgery recommends elective repair of AAA \u2265 5.5 cm in patients at \nlow or acceptable surgical risk.(1) \n\nUltrasound Screening Intervals* \n\u25cf Aneurysm size 2.5\u20133 cm, every 10 years \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm size 3.0\u20133.9 cm, every 3 years \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm size 4.0-4.9 cm, annually(2) \n\n\u25cf Aneurysm size 5.0-5.4 cm, every 6 months \n\nMRA and Renal Vein Thrombosis \nRenal vein thrombosis is a common complication of nephrotic syndrome and often occurs \nwith membranous glomerulonephritis. Gadolinium-enhanced MRA can demonstrate both the \nvenous and arterial anatomy and find filling defects within renal veins. The test can be used \nfor follow-up purposes as it does not use ionizing radiation. \n\nMRI/CT and Acute Hemorrhage \nMRI is not indicated and MRA/MRV (MR Angiography/Venography) is rarely indicated for \nevaluation of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, particularly in the acute setting. \nCT is usually the study of choice due to its availability, speed of the study, and less \nsusceptibility to artifact from patient motion. Advances in technology have allowed \nconventional CT to not just detect hematomas but also the source of acute vascular \nextravasation. In special cases, finer vascular detail to assess the specific source vessel \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 12 of 16 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 034-2 for Abdomen MRA/MRV (Angiography) \n\nresponsible for hemorrhage may require the use of CTA (e.g., CTA in diagnosis of lower \ngastrointestinal bleeding). (42) \n\nMRA/MRV is often utilized in non-acute situations to assess vascular structure involved in \natherosclerotic disease and its complications, vasculitis, venous thrombosis, vascular \ncongestion, or tumor invasion. Although some of these conditions may be associated with \nhemorrhage, it is usually not the primary reason MRI/MRA/MRV is selected for the \nevaluation. A special condition where MRI may be superior to CT for evaluating hemorrhage \nis to detect an underlying neoplasm as the cause of bleeding.(9) \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJune 2024 \u25cf Separated out aortic syndromes to be more clear \n\n\u25cf EVAR studies clarified order of which studies would be \nordered \n\n\u25cf Renal artery stenosis: updated per new clinical guidance \n\u25cf Added Genetic Syndromes and Tumors Section \n\u25cf Added PVD section \n\u25cf Statement put in all Guidelines for contraindications put in \n\nindications and background sections \n\u25cf Combo section adjusted and made uniform \n\u25cf Updated references and background sections \n\nMarch 2023 \u25cf Aneurysm: specified guidance on initial imaging and \nscreening intervals with emphasis on requiring ultrasound on \ninitial imaging and indications for advanced imaging, specified \nguidance on post-repair imaging \n\n\u25cf Other vascular abnormalities: clarified indication for non-aortic \nvascular conditions \n\n\u25cf Transplant: added section \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 13 of 16 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 034-2 for Abdomen MRA/MRV (Angiography) \n\n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Added statement regarding further evaluation of indeterminate \nfindings on prior imaging \n\n\u25cf Aligned sections across body imaging guidelines \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

Guideline 028 for Heart MRI \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician. All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nCMR is an imaging modality used to assess cardiac or vascular anatomy, function, \nperfusion, and tissue characteristics in a single examination. In lesions affecting the right \nheart, CMR provides excellent visualization and volume determination regardless of RV \nshape. This is particularly useful in patients with congenital heart disease. \n\nSpecial Note \nSince many cardiac patients have cardiac implanted electrical devices, the risk of CMR to \nthe patient and the device must be weighed against the benefit to the patient in terms of \nclinical value in optimal management (1,2,3,4). \n\nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in Washington State \n\nCLINICAL REASONING \nAll criteria are substantiated by the latest evidence-based medical literature. To enhance \ntransparency and reference, Appropriate Use (AUC) scores, when available, are diligently \nlisted alongside the criteria. \n\nIn instances where an AUC has not been established through prior publication, we adhere to \na standardized practice of assigning an AUC score of 6. This score is determined by \nconsidering variables that ensure the delivery of patient-centered care in line with current \nguidelines, with a focus on achieving benefits that outweigh associated risks. This approach \naims to maintain a robust foundation for decision-making and underscores our commitment \nto upholding the highest standards of care.

All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nThis guideline includes clinical criteria for coronary artery calcium scoring, by either EBCT or \nnon-contrast CCT. CAC testing provides a quantitative assessment of coronary artery \ncalcium content in Agatston units, as an adjunct to the estimation of global risk\u2c61 for coronary \nor cardiovascular events over the next 10 years. A CAC Score > 0 is a highly specific feature \nof coronary atherosclerosis. (1,2) \n\nSpecial Note \nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in: State of New Mexico, State of \nTexas and State of Washington \n\nClinical Reasoning \nAll criteria are either supported by Appropriate Use Scores or clinical reasoning that \nrepresents a standard of care that considers variables to deliver patient-centered care, \nsupported by current guidelines endorsed by the American College of Cardiology and the \nAmerican Heart Association. Care should always be determined on a case-by-case basis \nand reflect the best needs of the patient. \n\nINDICATIONS FOR CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM \n(CAC) TESTING \nPatients, regardless of age, can be considered for CAC testing when there is well-\ndocumented evidence of one of the following (3,4,5,6): \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 3 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 029 for Electron-Beam Tomography or Non-Contrast Coronary Computed \n\nTomography \n\n\u25cf For asymptomatic patients, without known coronary disease, at intermediate global \nrisk (7.5%-19.9%) (AUC 8) \n\n\u25cf For asymptomatic patients, without known coronary disease, that are at either \nborderline global risk (5%-7.4%) (AUC 7) or estimated 10-year risk of less than 5%, \nbut are suspected to be at elevated ASCVD risk because of one or more major risk \nfactor (listed below) not accounted for in global risk equations (1,3,5,7,8,9,10): \n\n\u25cb Family history of premature ASCVD \n\n\u25cb Persistently elevated LDL-C > 160 mg/dl or non-HDL-C > 190 mg/dl \n\n\u25cb Chronic kidney disease \n\n\u25cb Metabolic syndrome \n\n\u25cb Conditions specific to women (e.g., pre-eclampsia, premature menopause) (10) \n\n\u25cb Inflammatory diseases (HIV, psoriasis, RA) \n\n\u25cb Ethnicity (e.g., South Asian ancestry) \n\n\u25cb Persistently elevated triglycerides (> 175 mg/dl) \n\n\u25cb hsCRP > 2 mg/L \n\n\u25cb Lp(a) levels > 50 mg/dl \n\n\u25cb apoB > 130 mg/dl \n\n\u25cb ABI < 0.9, 15 \n\n\u25cf For asymptomatic patients, without known coronary disease, where there is a need \nfor alternative lipid-lowering strategies when statin therapy is contraindicated, due to \nadverse effects or patient reluctance (8,9) \n\n\u25cf CAC testing may be repeated indefinitely for re-assessment of the asymptomatic \npatient without known coronary disease after a minimum of 5 years until the calcium \nscore breaches 400 or up to twice if the calcium score remains zero.  \n\nLEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS \nState of New Mexico (11) \n\n\u25cf A group health plan, other than a small group health plan or a blanket health \ninsurance policy or contract that is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this \nstate shall provide coverage for eligible insureds to receive a heart artery calcium \nscan. \n\n\u25cf Coverage provided pursuant to this section shall: \n\n\u25cb be limited to the provision of a heart artery calcium scan to an eligible insured to \nbe used as a clinical management tool; \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 029 for Electron-Beam Tomography or Non-Contrast Coronary Computed \n\nTomography \n\n\u25cb be provided every five years if an eligible insured has previously received a heart \nartery calcium score of zero; and \n\n\u25cb not be required for future heart artery calcium scans if an eligible insured receives \na heart artery calcium score greater than zero. \n\n\u25cf At its discretion or as required by law, an insurer may offer or refuse coverage for \nfurther cardiac testing or procedures for eligible insureds based upon the results of a \nheart artery calcium scan. \n\n\u25cf The provisions of this section do not apply to short-term travel, accident-only or \nlimited or specified-disease policies, plans or certificates of health insurance. \n\n\u25cf As used in this section: \n\n\u25cb \"eligible insured\" means an insured who: \n\n\u25a0 is a person between the ages of forty-five and sixty-five; and \n\n\u25a0 has an intermediate risk of developing coronary heart disease as determined \nby a health care provider based upon a score calculated from an evidence-\nbased algorithm widely used in the medical community to assess a person's \nten-year cardiovascular disease risk, including a score calculated using a \npooled cohort equation; \n\n\u25cb \"health care provider\" means a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner \nor other health care professional authorized to furnish health care services within \nthe scope of the professional's license; and \n\n\u25cb \"heart artery calcium scan\" means a computed tomography scan measuring \ncoronary artery calcium for atherosclerosis and abnormal artery structure and \nfunction. \n\nState of Texas (12) \n\u25cf A health benefit plan that provides coverage for screening medical procedures must \n\nprovide the minimum coverage required by this section to each covered individual: \n\n\u25cb who is: \n\n\u25a0 a male older than 45 years of age and younger than 76 years of age; or \n\n\u25a0 a female older than 55 years of age and younger than 76 years of age; and \n\n\u25cb who: \n\n\u25a0 is diabetic; or \n\n\u25a0 has a risk of developing coronary heart disease, based on a score derived \nusing the Framingham Heart Study coronary prediction algorithm, that is \nintermediate or higher. \n\n\u25cf The minimum coverage required to be provided under this section is coverage of up \nto $200 for one of the following noninvasive screening tests for atherosclerosis and \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 029 for Electron-Beam Tomography or Non-Contrast Coronary Computed \n\nTomography \n\nabnormal artery structure and function every five years, performed by a laboratory \nthat is certified by a national organization recognized by the commissioner by rule for \nthe purposes of this section: \n\n\u25cb computed tomography (CT) scanning measuring coronary artery calcification;

Documentation is required that the results of the study will affect decision making \nfor preventative actions (i.e., statin therapy). CAC testing is a cardiovascular risk \nassessment tool, applicable only to the patient without known cardiovascular disease, for the \npurpose of primary prevention. It is not for the patient with suspected or known \ncardiovascular disease, coronary or otherwise, who already requires aggressive risk factor \nmodification. This test is not to be utilized for symptomatic patients in active ischemic \nevaluation. \n\nCAC score > 100 can also provide support for aspirin therapy and statin therapy (1,14). \nCalcium scores are used to help determine the use and dosage of statin therapy in patients \nwith various risks of developing clinically symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. Once \nsymptomatic coronary disease has been established or once the patient is considered high \nrisk, the usefulness of calcium scoring falls away as patients should be on high dose therapy \nand the results of a calcium score would add no further benefit. If a patient is symptomatic, \nnon-invasive or invasive testing should remain first line. \n\n\u2c61 Global risk of CAD is defined as the probability of an asymptomatic patient without known \nCAD developing CAD, including myocardial infarction or CAD death, over a given period of \ntime. Risk categories include: \n\n\u25cf Low risk (<5%) \n\n\u25cf Borderline risk (5% - 7.4%) \n\n\u25cf Intermediate risk (7.5% to 19.9%) \n\n\u25cf High risk (\u2265 20%) \n\nLinks to Global Cardiovascular Risk Calculators \nRisk Calculator \n  \n\nWebsite for Online Calculator \n\nFramingham \nCardiovascular Risk \n\nhttps://reference.medscape.com/calculator/framingham-\ncardiovascular-disease-risk \n  \n\nReynolds Risk Score (can \nuse if no diabetes, unique \nfor use of family history) \n  \n\nhttp://www.reynoldsriskscore.org/ \n\nPooled Cohort Equation http://clincalc.com/Cardiology/ASCVD/PooledCohort.aspx?example \n  \n\nACC/AHA Risk Calculator http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/ \n\nhttps://reference.medscape.com/calculator/framingham-cardiovascular-disease-risk\nhttps://reference.medscape.com/calculator/framingham-cardiovascular-disease-risk\nhttp://www.reynoldsriskscore.org/\nhttp://clincalc.com/Cardiology/ASCVD/PooledCohort.aspx?example\nhttp://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/\n\n\n \n\nPage 7 of 10 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 029 for Electron-Beam Tomography or Non-Contrast Coronary Computed \n\nTomography \n\nAcronyms / Abbreviations \nASCAD: Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease \nASCVD: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease \nCAC: Coronary artery calcium \nCAD: Coronary artery disease \nCCT: Cardiac computed tomography \nEBCT: Electron beam computed tomography \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJuly 2024 \u25cf Formatting change \n\n\u25cf Addition of clinical reasoning statement with AUC scoring \ndescribed \n\n\u25cf AUC scores added to bullet points \n\u25cf Clarifying statement that this test is not to be utilized for \n\nsymptomatic patients \n\u25cf References updated \n\u25cf Added Legislative Language for Washington \n\nApril 2023 \u25cf Removed age limitations for CAC testing \n\u25cf Added new references \n\u25cf Added statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \n\nguideline \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nIndications for determining medical necessity for Coronary and/or Cardiac Computed \nTomographic Angiography (CCTA). Patients should be on maximally tolerated guideline \ndirected medical therapy (GDMT), when applicable.  \n\nSpecial Note \nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in Washington State. \n\nCLINICAL REASONING \nAll criteria are substantiated by the latest evidence-based medical literature. To enhance \ntransparency and reference, Appropriate Use (AUC) scores, when available, are diligently \nlisted alongside the criteria. \n\nThis guideline first defaults to AUC scores established by published, evidence-based \nguidance endorsed by professional medical organizations. In the absence of those scores, \nwe adhere to a standardized practice of assigning an AUC score of 6. This score is \ndetermined by considering variables that ensure the delivery of patient-centered care in line \nwith current guidelines, with a focus on achieving benefits that outweigh associated \nrisks. This approach aims to maintain a robust foundation for decision-making and \nunderscores our commitment to upholding the highest standards of care.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) generates images of the blood vessels in the \nabdomen and lower extremities that can be evaluated for evidence of stenosis or occlusion \nwith the use of ionizing radiation, which is a potential hazard in patients with impaired renal \nfunction.  \n\nINDICATIONS \nPeripheral Vascular Disease (1,2,3,4) \n\n\u25cf For evaluation of known or suspected lower extremity arterial disease): \n\n\u25cb For known or suspected peripheral arterial disease (such as claudication, or \nclinical concern for vascular causes of ulcers) when non-invasive studies (pulse \nvolume recording, ankle-brachial index, toe brachial index, segmental pressures, \nor doppler ultrasound) are abnormal or equivocal OR \n\n\u25cb For critical limb ischemia with ANY of the below clinical signs of peripheral artery \ndisease (prior ultrasound is not needed; if done and negative, CTA should still be \napproved) (5,6) \n\n\u25a0 Ischemic rest pain \n\n\u25a0 Tissue Loss \n\n\u25a0 Gangrene \n\n\u25cb After stenting or surgery with signs of recurrent symptoms, abnormal \nankle/brachial index, abnormal or indeterminate arterial Doppler, OR abnormal or \nindeterminate pulse volume recording \n\nNOTE: When vascular imaging of the aorta and both legs, i.e., CTA aortogram and runoff is \ndesired (sometimes incorrectly requested as Abd/Pelvis CTA & Lower Extremity CTA \nRunoff), only one authorization request is required, using CPT Code 75635 CTA Aortogram. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 3 of 7 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 035 for Abdominal Aorta CT Angiography with Lower Extremity Runoff \n\nThis study provides for imaging of the abdomen, pelvis, and both legs. A separate \nauthorization for Lower Extremity CTA is NOT needed. \n\nPre-operative/Procedure Evaluation \n\u25cf Evaluation of interventional vascular procedures for luminal patency versus \n\nrestenosis due to conditions such as atherosclerosis, thromboembolism, and intimal \nhyperplasia \n\nPost-Operative/Post-Procedural Evaluation \n\u25cf Evaluation of post-operative complications, e.g., pseudoaneurysms related to \n\nsurgical bypass grafts, vascular stents, and stent-grafts \n\n\u25cf Follow-up study may be needed to help evaluate a patient\u2019s progress after treatment, \nprocedure, intervention, or surgery.  \n\n\u25cb Documentation requires a medical reason that clearly indicates why additional \nimaging is needed for the type and area(s) requested. \n\nFurther Evaluation of Indeterminate Findings on Prior \nImaging \nUnless follow-up is otherwise specified within the guideline: \n\n\u25cf For initial evaluation of an inconclusive finding on a prior imaging report that requires \nfurther clarification  \n\n\u25cf One follow-up exam of a prior indeterminate MR/CT finding to ensure no suspicious \ninterval change has occurred. (No further surveillance unless specified as highly \nsuspicious or change was found on last follow-up exam) \n\nGenetic Syndromes and Rare Diseases \n\u25cf Williams Syndrome:(7) \n\n\u25cb When there is concern for vascular disease (including renal artery stenosis) \nbased on abnormal exam or imaging findings (such as diminished pulses, bruits \nor signs of diffuse thoracic aortic stenosis) \n\n\u25cf For other syndromes and rare diseases not otherwise addressed in the guideline, \ncoverage is based on a case-by-case basis using societal guidance \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 7 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 035 for Abdominal Aorta CT Angiography with Lower Extremity Runoff \n\nCombinations Studies \nAbdominal Aorta CT Angiography with Lower Extremity Runoff \nand Chest CTA \n\n\u25cf To evaluate for an embolic source of lower extremity vascular disease when other \nimaging such as echocardiography suggests a cardiac source of the embolism \n\n\u25cf  Williams Syndrome: When there is concern for vascular disease (including renal \nartery stenosis) based on abnormal exam or imaging findings (such as diminished \npulses, bruits or signs of diffuse thoracic aortic stenosis)(7) \n\nCODING AND STANDARDS \nCoding \nCPT Codes \n75635 \n\nApplicable Lines of Business \n\u2612 CHIP (Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) \n\u2612 Commercial \n\u2612 Exchange/Marketplace \n\u2612 Medicaid \n\u2612 Medicare Advantage \n\nBACKGROUND \nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester). \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds weight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 7 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 035 for Abdominal Aorta CT Angiography with Lower Extremity Runoff \n\nSuspected Peripheral Arterial Disease \nCTA (or MRA) is an excellent tool to diagnose lower extremity peripheral arterial disease \n(PAD). Benefits include the fast-scanning time and accurate detection of occlusions and \nstenosis. According to the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines, \u201cMeasurement of the \nankle-brachial index (ABI) is the primary method for establishing the diagnosis of PAD.  An \nABI of \u22640.90 has been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity for the \nidentification of PAD compared with the gold standard of invasive arteriography.\u201d (2) The \npresence of a normal ABI at rest and following exercise almost excludes atherosclerotic \ndisease as a cause for leg claudication. (1,7) \n\nWhen an ABI is >1.40 (suggesting noncompressible calcified vessels) and clinical suspicion \nis high, other tests such as toe-brachial index <8, a resting toe pressure <40 mm Hg, a \nsystolic peak posterior tibial artery flow velocity < 10cm/s may be used. \u201cIn symptomatic \npatients in whom revascularization treatment is being considered, we recommend anatomic \nimaging studies, such as arterial duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA, and contrast arteriography.\u201d \n(2) This later statement is accompanied by a \u201cB\u201d (moderate) rating for the accompanying \nevidence (\u201cA\u201d = high, \u201cC\u201d = low) \u201cIn patients with limited renal function or planned surgical \nintervention, noninvasive imaging tests (particularly MRA and CTA) may obviate the need for \ndiagnostic catheter angiography to visualize the location and severity of peripheral vascular \ndisease.\u201d (2) \n\nFollow-up imaging post vascular surgery procedures have not been well researched without \nclear surveillance protocols in place. Clinical exam, ABI and EUS within the first month of \nendovascular therapy are generally recommended to assess for residual stenosis, and again \nat 6 and 12 months, then annually. More sophisticated imaging with CTA, MRA, or invasive \ncatheter angiography is reserved for complex cases.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1) \nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive imaging technique which can be \nuseful when conventional imaging (CT or MR) provides limited information regarding a \nspecific clinical question. MRS is sensitive but not specific and results should be closely \ncorrelated with clinical history, physical examination, laboratory results, and diagnostic \nimaging studies. (2) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR BRAIN MRS (2) \n\u25cf For the evaluation of a recurrent or residual brain tumor from post-treatment \n\nchanges, e.g., radiation necrosis(2,3,4) \n\n\u25cf For further evaluation of a brain lesion to distinguish a brain tumor from other non-\ntumor diagnoses (e.g., abscess or other infectious or inflammatory process)(1,5) \n\n\u25cf Suspected inherited metabolic disorders such as Canavan disease and primary \nmitochondrial disorders. (6) Can be done in combination with Brain MRI when not \npreviously performed. (7,8) \n\nCODING AND STANDARDS \nCoding \nCPT Codes \n76390, +0698T \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 3 of 6 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 003 for Brain Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) \n\nApplicable Lines of Business \n\u2612 CHIP (Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) \n\u2612 Commercial \n\u2612 Exchange/Marketplace \n\u2612 Medicaid \n\u2612 Medicare Advantage \n\nBACKGROUND \nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) determines the concentration of brain metabolites, \nsuch as N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, and lactate, within the body tissue examined. \nRadiofrequency waves are translated into biochemical composition of the scanned tissue; \nthe resulting metabolic profile is useful in identifying brain tumors, e.g., differentiating \nneoplastic and non-neoplastic brain lesions.  This modality should be considered as an \nadjunct to conventional imaging rather than replacement for histopathological evaluation.(9) \nIn terms of brain tumor evaluation and classification, carefully designed multi-center trials \ncomplying with criteria of evidence-based medicine have not yet been completed. (10) \n\nTumor Recurrence vs. Radiation Necrosis (4) \nDifferentiation between recurrent brain tumors and treatment related injury, e.g., radiation \nnecrosis, is difficult using conventional MRI.  MRS is a quantitative approach, measuring \nvarious brain metabolic markers, to help in the differentiation of recurrent tumors vs. \nradiation necrosis. (3) However, no consensus exists regarding the value of this in clinical \ndecision making, and no approach has yet been validated to be sufficiently accurate. (2,4) \n\nGlioma (4,11) \nMRS has been proposed for pre-operative grading of gliomas and differentiating high-grade \ngliomas (HGGs) from low-grade gliomas. It has been found to have moderate diagnostic \nvalue and should be combined with other advanced imaging techniques to improve \naccuracy. Currently, the data is limited; more research is needed for a definite conclusion for \nthe utility of MRS for this indication. Therefore, it remains experimental/investigational.(12,13) \n\nInherited Metabolic Conditions (6) \nAlthough Brain MRS may show abnormalities in many inherited metabolic conditions, \nprimary mitochondrial disease, storage diseases and other neurometabolic disorders \n(including leukodystrophies), it\u2019s role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of most \nof these conditions is not well established by research and condition-specific guidelines. In a \nselect few conditions MRS does have a more specific role in diagnosis and/or management \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 6 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 003 for Brain Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) \n\n(primary mitochondrial disorders and Canavan disease). For most of these conditions, Brain \nMRS is considered Experimental/Investigational. In all cases, basic work-up should first be \ncompleted including appropriate family history for inheritance and specific labs related to the \nsuspected condition. \n\nMRS in other Diseases \nA role for MRS has been suggested in the management of neurodegenerative disease, \nepilepsy, and stroke.  MRS can also be applied in conjunction with MRI in the evaluation  \ntraumatic brain injury and neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.(14,15) However, to better define these \nroles, it will be necessary to standardize the MRS methodology, as well as the collection, \nanalysis, and interpretation of data so it can be consistently translated to the applicable \nclinical settings.  Currently, these potential applications remain \nexperimental/investigational.(15) \n\nContraindication and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester) \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds wight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nMay 2024 \u25cf Update references and background. \n\n\u25cf Added Contraindications and preferred studies section. \n\u25cf Added pediatric metabolic disorders section. \n\nMay 2023 \u25cf Updated references \n\u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 6 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 003 for Brain Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nWhole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) generates images of the whole body (skull \nbase to mid-thigh) without the use of ionizing radiation. It is used to evaluate for conditions \nwhere imaging of the whole body is needed such as certain genetic syndromes and rare \ndiseases. MRI can also be used for radiation planning. CPT 76498 is used for either Whole \nBody MRI or radiation planning MRI. \n\nWhole Body Low Dose Computed Tomography (CT) generates images of the whole \nskeleton and can be used when images of the entire skeletal system is needed such as for \ncertain hematologic malignancies. CPT 76497 is used when Whole Body Low Dose CT is \nneeded. \n\nSpecial Note \nWhen used for CT or MRI, another CPT code should be selected that describes the specific \nservice being requested.

Breast MRI is typically \nbilateral to allow for assessment of symmetry between the breasts. MRI findings should be \ncorrelated with clinical history, physical examination, and the results of mammography and \nany other prior breast imaging. \n\nNOTE: The age of a family member\u2019s diagnosis is only relevant for patients under the age of \n40.  Anyone 40 or over should be getting annual mammograms and breast MRIs if their \nlifetime risk is 20% or greater. \n\nSpecial Note \nLegislative Requirements \nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in:  State of Connecticut; State of \nIllinois; State of North Carolina, State of Ohio,  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, State \nof Washington. \n\nINDICATIONS \nFor screening examination to detect breast cancer in any of the following situations. It is \nappropriate to perform screening breast MRI at routine intervals in patients at increased risk \nwho are lactating.  \n\nContrast-enhanced MRI is not recommended during pregnancy due to the trans-placental \npassage of gadolinium and potential concern for the exposure of the fetus to gadolinium. \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\nPage 4 of 15 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 023 for Breast MRI \n\nNo

MRI findings should be correlated with clinical history, physical \nexamination, and the results of mammography and any other prior breast imaging. \n\nOVERVIEW \nMRI and risk evaluation \u2013 The age of a family member\u2019s diagnosis is only relevant for patients under \nthe age of 40.  Anyone 40 or over should be getting annual mammograms and breast MRIs if their \nlifetime risk is 20% or greater. \n\nNipple discharge \u2013 Nipple discharge is a common complaint with at least 80% of women having at least \n1 episode. Discharge that is considered pathologic is unilateral, spontaneous, from one duct orifice and \nserous or bloody.  Physiologic discharge will be bilateral, from multiple ducts, and white, green, or \nyellow in color. \u201cIn general, MRI may be considered in cases in which mammography and US have \nfailed to identify an underlying cause of pathologic nipple discharge. The sensitivities of breast MRI for \ndetecting the cause of the pathologic nipple discharge are 86% to 100% for invasive cancer and 40% to \n100% for noninvasive disease\u201d.35  Ductography (galactography) has the ability to demonstrate small \nlesions in the specific duct that is secreting the pathologic nipple discharge. However, it is invasive and \nmay cause discomfort and pain. It can be time-consuming and technically challenging and the rate of \ninadequate or incomplete ductography is as high as 15%. The discharge must be present on the day of \nthe study so that a cannula can be placed in the appropriate duct. Failure to cannulate the discharging \nduct may occur and cannulation of the wrong duct may cause a false-negative ductogram.35 \n\nPage 8 of 13 \nBreast MRI \n\n*Evolent refers to Evolent Health LLC and Evolent Specialty Services, Inc.\n\n\u00a9 1997-2024 Evolent, All Rights Reserved.\n\nhttps://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/solarapi/v1/general_assembly_134/bills/hb371/EN/06/hb371_06_EN?format=pdf\n\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

Patients \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 6 of 8 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 060-2 for CT Bone Density Study \n\nwho have a BMD that is 2.5 standard deviations below that of a \u201cyoung normal\u201d adult (T-\nscore at or below -2.5) are deemed to have osteoporosis. Quantitative computed \ntomography (QCT) has not been validated for WHO criteria but can identify patients with low \nBMD compared to the QCT reference database, and it can be used to identify patients who \nare at risk of fracture. \n\nDXA and QTC \nDual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is most often used to measure bone mineral density \ndue to its low radiation exposure, low precision error, and capacity to measure multiple \nskeletal sites (spine, hip, or total body). \n\nAxial DXA provides the \u201cgold standard\u201d. Axial DXA predicts fracture risk at the site being \nmeasured. \n\nPeripheral DXA measures BMD at peripheral sites, generally at the heel or wrist. It is \nrelatively cheap and portable and is an option when there is limited access to axial DXA. \n\nQuantitative computed tomography (QCT) measures volumetric integral, trabecular, and \ncortical bone density at the spine and hip and can be used to determine bone strength. \nRadiation dose is increased when compared with DXA. Indications are the same for QCT as \nDXA; however, DXA is recommended as the first-line test in most cases.

All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nSpecial Note \nA Heart PET scan for Ischemic evaluation is indicated when all the criteria for MPI are met \nAND there is likely to be equivocal imaging results because of BMI, large breasts or \nimplants, mastectomy, chest wall deformity, pleural or pericardial effusion, or prior thoracic \nsurgery or results of a prior MPI (1,2). (AUC 7) (3) \n\nCardiac PET scanning, when used in conjunction with CT attenuation, includes evaluation of \nperfusion, function, viability, inflammation, anatomy, and risk stratification for cardiac-related \nevents such as myocardial infarction and death. Maximum diagnostic accuracy of cardiac \nPET/CT is achieved when images are interpreted in conjunction with other relevant imaging, \nclinical information, and laboratory data. \n\nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in Washington State \n\nCLINICAL REASONING \nAll criteria are substantiated by the latest evidence-based medical literature. To enhance \ntransparency and reference, Appropriate Use (AUC) scores, when available, are diligently \nlisted alongside the criteria. \n\nThis guideline first defaults to AUC scores established by published, evidence-based \nguidance endorsed by professional medical organizations. In the absence of those scores, \nwe adhere to a standardized practice of assigning an AUC score of 6. This score is \ndetermined by considering variables that ensure the delivery of patient-centered care in line \nwith current guidelines, with a focus on achieving benefits that outweigh associated risks. \nThis approach aims to maintain a robust foundation for decision-making and underscores \nour commitment to upholding the highest standards of care.

blood flow to the heart. During the test, a \nsmall amount of radioactive tracer is injected into a vein. A special camera, called a gamma \ncamera, detects the radiation released by the tracer to produce computer images of the \nheart. Combined with a medication, the test can help determine if there is adequate blood \nflow to the heart during activity versus at rest. The medication simulates exercise for patients \nunable to exercise on a treadmill or stationary cycle. \n\nPET prefusion studies illustrate myocardial blood flow by demonstrating tracer uptake. PET \nmetabolic evaluation studies are used to demonstrate inflammation produced by infiltrative \ndisease such as sarcoidosis, but also enhance the detection of viable (hibernating) \nmyocardium. Hybrid PET-CT scanning combines anatomical information with blood flow \nassessment and is useful for assessing viable myocardium, especially in CHF patients with \nglobal ischemia, or in patients with multivessel diffuse coronary artery disease as opposed to \nfocal stenotic lesions. \n\nAUC Score \nA reasonable diagnostic or therapeutic procedure care can be defined as that for which the \nexpected clinical benefits outweigh the associated risks, enhancing patient care and health \noutcomes in a cost-effective manner.

Guideline 024 for Myocardial Perfusion Imaging \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nSpecial Note \nMedical necessity for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) will consider the preference for \nappropriate alternatives, such as stress echocardiography (SE), when deemed more \nsuitable, unless contraindications are present (see DEFINITIONS section). Preference \ntoward stress echocardiography will be denoted by  \n\nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in Washington State. \n\nClinical Reasoning \nAll criteria are substantiated by the latest evidence-based medical literature. To enhance \ntransparency and reference, Appropriate Use (AUC) scores, when available, are diligently \nlisted alongside the criteria. \n\nThis guideline first defaults to AUC scores established by published, evidence-based \nguidance endorsed by professional medical organizations. In the absence of those scores, \nwe adhere to a standardized practice of assigning an AUC score of 6. This score is \ndetermined by considering variables that ensure the delivery of patient-centered care in line \nwith current guidelines, with a focus on achieving benefits that outweigh associated \nrisks.  This approach aims to maintain a robust foundation for decision-making and \nunderscores our commitment to upholding the highest standards of care. (1,2,3,4,5) \n\nINDICATIONS FOR MPI (6,7,8,9,10) \nSuspected Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) \n\n\u25cf Symptomatic patients without known CAD.  No imaging stress test within the \nlast 12 months.

imaging is used primarily for the evaluation of coronary artery disease \nand determining prognosis. Myocardial perfusion imaging is a cardiac radionuclide imaging \nprocedure that evaluates blood flow to the cardiac muscle during rest or stress. Stress may \nbe provided by exercise or with pharmacologic agents. A variety of radionuclides may be \nused, including Technetium tc-99M sestamibi, thallium201 and Technetiumtc-99M \ntetrofosmin. \n\nFor those patients who are unable to complete the exercise protocol without achieving >85% \nof predicted maximal heart rate, a pharmacological nuclear stress test is recommended. This \ntesting method uses a drug to mimic the response of the cardiovascular system to exercise. \nAdenosine, Persantine, Dobutamine, or Regadenoson are vasodilators used in \npharmacological nuclear stress testing. A gamma camera is used to record images in planar \nor tomographic (single photon emission computed tomography, SPECT) projections. \n\nHigh global CAD risk is defined as 10-year CAD risk of >20%.

Its incorporation into global risk can be \nachieved by using the MESA risk calculator. \n\n\u25cb Ischemia-producing disease (also called hemodynamically or functionally \nsignificant disease, for which revascularization might be appropriate) generally \nimplies at least one of the following: \n\n\u25a0 Suggested by percentage diameter stenosis \u2265 70% by angiography; \nintermediate lesions are 50 \u2013 69%(9) \n\n\u25a0 For a left main artery, suggested by a percentage stenosis \u2265 50%(7,41,42) \n\n\u25a0 FFR (fractional flow reserve) \u2264 0.80 for a major vessel(41,42) \n\n\u25a0 Demonstrable ischemic findings on stress testing (ECG or stress imaging), \nthat are at least mild in degree \n\n\u25cb FFR (fractional flow reserve) is the distal to proximal pressure ratio across a \ncoronary lesion. Less than or equal to 0.80 is considered a significant reduction in \ncoronary flow.  \n\n\u25cf Anginal Equivalent (7,33) \n\nDevelopment of an anginal equivalent (e.g., shortness of breath, fatigue, or \nweakness) either with or without prior coronary revascularization should be based \nupon the documentation of reasons to suspect that symptoms other than chest \ndiscomfort are not due to other organ systems (e.g., dyspnea due to lung disease, \nfatigue due to anemia). This may include respiratory rate, oximetry, lung exam, etc. \n(as well as d-dimer, chest CT(A), and/or PFTs, when appropriate), and then \nincorporated into the evaluation of coronary artery disease as would chest \ndiscomfort. Syncope per se is not an anginal equivalent.  \n\nhttps://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/MESACHDRisk/MesaRiskScore/RiskScore.aspx\nhttps://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/MESACHDRisk/MesaRiskScore/RiskScore.aspx\n\n\n \n\nPage 16 of 21 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 024 for Myocardial Perfusion Imaging \n\nAcronyms / Abbreviations \nADLs: Activities of daily living \nBSA: Body surface area in square meters \nCABG: Coronary artery bypass grafting \nCAD: Coronary artery disease \nCMR: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging \nCTA: Computed tomography angiography \nECG: Electrocardiogram \nFFR: Fractional flow reserve \nIVUS: Intravascular ultrasound          \nLBBB: Left bundle-branch block \nLVEF: Left ventricular ejection fraction \nLVH: Left ventricular hypertrophy \nMI: Myocardial infarction \nMET: Estimated metabolic equivalent of exercise \nMPI: Myocardial perfusion imaging \nPCI: Percutaneous coronary intervention \nPFT: Pulmonary function test \nPVCs: Premature ventricular contractions \nSE: Stress echocardiography \nTHR: Target heart rate \nVT: Ventricular tachycardia \nVF: Ventricular fibrillation \nWPW: Wolf Parkinson White \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nJuly 2024 \u25cf Added AUC Scoring to Cardiac Guidelines from published \n\nSocieties.

All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nSpecial Note \nIndications for determining medical necessity for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with \nappropriate preference for suitable alternatives, such as stress echocardiography (SE), \nwhen more suitable, unless otherwise stated (see Definitions section). \n\nIndicated when all the criteria for MPI are met AND there is likely to be equivocal imaging \nresults because of BMI, large breasts or implants, mastectomy, chest wall deformity, pleural \nor pericardial effusion, or prior thoracic surgery or results of a prior MPI. (1,2) (AUC 7) (3) \n\nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in Washington State. \n\nCLINICAL REASONING \nAll criteria are substantiated by the latest evidence-based medical literature. To enhance \ntransparency and reference, Appropriate Use (AUC) scores, when available, are diligently \nlisted alongside the criteria. \n\nThis guideline first defaults to AUC scores established by published, evidence-based \nguidance endorsed by professional medical organizations. In the absence of those scores, \nwe adhere to a standardized practice of assigning an AUC score of 6. This score is \ndetermined by considering variables that ensure the delivery of patient-centered care in line \nwith current guidelines, with a focus on achieving benefits that outweigh associated risks. \nThis approach aims to maintain a robust foundation for decision-making and underscores \nour commitment to upholding the highest standards of care.

During the test, a \nsmall amount of radioactive tracer is injected into a vein. A special camera, called a gamma \ncamera, detects the radiation released by the tracer to produce computer images of the \nheart. Combined with a medication, the test can help determine if there is adequate blood \nflow to the heart during activity versus at rest. The medication simulates exercise for patients \nunable to exercise on a treadmill or stationary cycle. \n\nPET prefusion studies illustrate myocardial blood flow by demonstrating tracer uptake. PET \nmetabolic evaluation studies are used to demonstrate inflammation produced by infiltrative \ndisease such as sarcoidosis, but also enhance the detection of viable (hibernating) \nmyocardium. Hybrid PET-CT scanning combines anatomical information with blood flow \nassessment and is useful for assessing viable myocardium, especially in CHF patients with \nglobal ischemia, or in patients with multivessel diffuse coronary artery disease as opposed to \nfocal stenotic lesions. \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 11 of 22 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 072 for Heart (Cardiac) PET  \n\nAUC Score \nA reasonable diagnostic or therapeutic procedure care can be defined as that for which the \nexpected clinical benefits outweigh the associated risks, enhancing patient care and health \noutcomes in a cost-effective manner.

These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose (1,2,3,4) \nMultiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning uses radiolabeled red blood cells to scan right \nand left ventricular images in a cine loop format that is synchronized with the \nelectrocardiogram. \n\nA prior MUGA scan is not an indication for repeat MUGA (if another modality would be \nsuitable, i.e., TTE). \n\nSpecial Note \nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in Washington State \n\nClinical Reasoning \nAll criteria are substantiated by the latest evidence-based medical literature. To enhance \ntransparency and reference, Appropriate Use (AUC) scores, when available, are diligently \nlisted alongside the criteria. \n\nThis guideline first defaults to AUC scores established by published, evidence-based \nguidance endorsed by professional medical organizations. In the absence of those scores, \nwe adhere to a standardized practice of assigning an AUC score of 6. This score is \ndetermined by considering variables that ensure the delivery of patient-centered care in line \nwith current guidelines, with a focus on achieving benefits that outweigh associated risks. \nThis approach aims to maintain a robust foundation for decision-making and underscores \nour commitment to upholding the highest standards of care.

Myocardial perfusion imaging is used primarily for \nthe evaluation of coronary artery disease. Ventriculography is sometimes referred to as \nmultiple gated acquisition scanning (MUGA) and is primarily used to evaluate valvular \ndisease and cardiomyopathies. Either type of study may be obtained at rest or stress. \n\nRadionuclide Ventriculography is a medical imaging test used to determine a patient's \ncardiac function in the right, or more typically, left ventricle. Cardiac ventriculography \ninvolves injecting a radioisotope into the heart's ventricle(s) through a peripheral vein to \nmeasure the volume of blood pumped. Both regional and global left ventricular function \n(ejection fraction) as well as left ventricular size is measured. \n\nAUC Score \nA reasonable diagnostic or therapeutic procedure care can be defined as that for which the \nexpected clinical benefits outweigh the associated risks, enhancing patient care and health \noutcomes in a cost effective manner.

078 for SPECT \n\nSTATEMENT \nGeneral Information \nIt is an expectation that all patients receive care/services from a licensed clinician.\u202f All \nappropriate supporting documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria. These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nSPECT: Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a nuclear medicine \nimaging technique used to localize data from gamma ray emitting injected \nradiopharmaceuticals to specific anatomical locations within the patient. The resulting 3D \nimages can be reconstructed in multiple planes much like a CT scan uses XR, SPECT \nutilizes nuclear scintigraphy.  \n\nSPECT can be used localize a tumor, inflammatory process, or radioactive tracer \ndistribution. Vascular flow and blood pool imaging are included if performed. The 78803 \ncode represents single\u2013day imaging of a single area, such as the head, neck, chest, or \npelvis, or a single acquisition on one day. \n\nSPECT/CT: (Single-photon emission computed tomography combined with Computed \nTomography) is now available in many places. The CT portion helps correct the attenuation \n(decrease) of photons from the target as they get absorbed/reflected by the soft tissues \nbefore reaching the detector. CT helps with anatomic localization much like the CT of \nPET/CT. \n\nWhen SPECT/CT is requested, additional CT approvals are NOT needed/provided (unless \napprovable for other separate indications per guidelines for that body part).

documentation, including recent pertinent office visit notes, laboratory \ndata, and results of any special testing must be provided.\u202f\u202fIf applicable: All prior relevant \nimaging results and the reason that alternative imaging cannot be performed must be included \nin the documentation submitted.\u202f \n\nWhere a specific clinical indication is not directly addressed in this guideline, medical necessity \ndetermination will be made based on widely accepted standard of care criteria.  These criteria \nare supported by evidence-based or peer-reviewed sources such as medical literature, \nsocietal guidelines and state/national recommendations. \n\nPurpose \nOncologic PET is generally indicated for biopsy-proven cancer or strongly suspected cancer \nbased on other diagnostic testing. The appropriateness of an ordered PET/CT study is \ndependent on the type of cancer and which radiopharmaceutical will be used for the \nPET/CT. \n\nSpecial Note \nLegislative Requirements \nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in the State of Washington \n\nSee Legislative Requirements for specific mandates in the State of Arkansas \n\nINDICATIONS \nBone Tumors & Sarcomas \nAngiosarcoma (1) \n\n\u25cf Initial Staging \n\n\u25cb Indicated \n\n\u25a0 Chest CT, CT or MRI of the primary site, Brain MRI AND whole spine MRI are \nindicated in addition to PET \n\n\u25cf Restaging \n\n\u25cb Indicated \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 45 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 070-1 for PET Scan \n\n\u25a0 Chest CT, CT or MRI of the primary site, Brain MRI AND whole spine MRI are \nindicated in addition to PET \n\nChondrosarcoma (2) \n\u25cf Initial Staging \n\n\u25cb NOT Indicated \n\n\u25cf Restaging \n\n\u25cb NOT Indicated \n\nChordoma (2) \n\u25cf Initial Staging \n\n\u25cb With prior indeterminate imaging \n\n\u25cf Restaging \n\n\u25cb With prior indeterminate imaging \n\nClear Cell Sarcoma (1) \n\u25cf Initial Staging \n\n\u25cb Indicated \n\n\u25a0 Chest CT AND CT or MRI of the primary site are indicated in addition to PET \n\n\u25cf Restaging \n\n\u25cb Indicated \n\n\u25a0 Chest CT AND CT or MRI of the primary site are indicated in addition to PET \n\nEpithelioid Sarcoma (1) \n\u25cf Initial Staging \n\n\u25cb Indicated \n\n\u25a0 Chest CT AND CT or MRI of the primary site are indicated in addition to PET \n\n\u25cf Restaging \n\n\u25cb Indicated \n\n\u25a0 Chest CT AND CT or MRI of the primary site are indicated in addition to PET \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 6 of 45 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 070-1 for PET Scan \n\nEwing Sarcoma (2) \n\u25cf Initial Staging \n\n\u25cb Indicated \n\n\u25a0 Chest CT AND CT or MRI of the primary site are indicated in addition to PET  \n\n\u25cf Restaging \n\n\u25cb Indicated \n\n\u25a0 Chest CT AND CT or MRI of the primary site are indicated in addition to PET \n\n\u25cf Surveillance \n\n\u25cb For patients with a history of metastatic disease, indicated every 3 months for 2 \nyears, then every 4 months up to year 3 post completion of treatment \n\n\u25a0 CT or MRI of the primary site are indicated in addition to PET \n\nGiant Cell Tumor of Bone (2) \n\u25cf Initial Staging \n\n\u25cb Not Indicated \n\n\u25cf Restaging \n\n\u25cb Not Indicated \n\nMalignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST) (1) \n\u25cf Initial Staging -

Recurrence is not required to be biopsy proven. \n\n\u25cb Imaging is typically performed 6-12 weeks after surgery \n\n\u25cb Imaging is typically performed 12 weeks after radiation (to avoid false positive \nfindings that can be caused by treatment changes or healing).  \n\n\u25a0 PET/CT can be performed 1 - 3 weeks after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or \nneoadjuvant chemoradiation if done for presurgical planning to evaluate for \ndistant metastatic disease or to evaluate known metastatic disease located in \nareas separate from the site(s) being radiated. \n\n\u25cb When an end of treatment PET scan performed at an appropriate post-treatment \ninterval (see above) shows indeterminate findings, one additional repeat PET in 3 \nmonths is indicated. \n\n\u25cb Common exceptions are noted in the guideline. If not noted in the guideline, a \nvalid clinical reason explaining why the interval needs to be shorter is needed.  \n\n\u25cf TREATMENT includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation, as well as patients \non \u201cmaintenance therapy\u201d who have known, or existing, metastatic disease being \ncontrolled by this treatment. Allogenic bone marrow transplant and CART T-cell \ntherapy should be considered \u2018active\u2019 treatment for at least 6 months after \ninfusion/transplant and as such can be approved at 30 days, 100 days, and 6 months \nafter the most recent infusion.  \n\n\u25cf INDETERMINATE IMAGING:  \n\u25cb When indeterminate imaging is required prior to PET, this typically means \n\nconventional imaging (CT, MRI, OR Nuclear Medicine Scan (i.e. bone scan)) \nshows a finding that is indeterminate AND clarification of that finding with PET \nwill potentially change management.  \n\n\u25cb The information provided should clearly explain why conventional imaging is \ninsufficient to determine treatment or management.  \n\n\u25cb Biopsy guidance:  \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 38 of 45 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 070-1 for PET Scan \n\n\u25a0 To determine the best location to biopsy either within a tumor that has \nnecrosis on imaging OR  \n\n\u25a0 To determine the best location to biopsy when there are findings on standard \nimaging that would require a significantly invasive procedure (such as \nlaparoscopic or open surgical procedures) AND malignancy is highly \nsuspected based on imaging. \n\n\u25cb When previous conventional imaging has been shown to be negative, yet a \nconcurrent PET scan was positive (i.e. conventional imaging was falsely \nnegative/ missed lesions seen on PET), we do not require repeat conventional \nimaging prior to every subsequent PET because conventional imaging was \nalready shown to be insufficient. Appropriate interval criteria should still be met. \n\nFurther Information \nPET with CONTRAINDICATIONS to contrasted CT AND MRI: The inability to image with \ncontrasted conventional imaging includes contraindications to both CT (such as chronic \nrenal failure with GFR < 30 OR significant iodinated contrast allergy) AND to MRI (such as \ngadolinium allergy, implanted device that is not MRI compatible, or GFR <40). When \nrequested for surveillance due to the above reasons, PET can be considered during the time \nthat the highest risk of recurrence for that cancer (typically the first two years after \ncompletion of treatment). \n\nPET/MR: When PET/MR can be considered per the guideline, if the criteria are met for PET \nfor that cancer and the plan is to do a PET/MR rather than a PET/CT, the PET scan can be \napproved. In the same way a separate approval for total body CT is not needed when a \nPET/CT is requested, a separate approval for the total body MR is not typically needed. \nHowever, until a PET/MR CPT code is implemented, unlisted MR in addition to PET can be \nconsidered on a case-to-case basis. \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nAugust 2024 \u25cf Reorganized: \n\n\u25cb Grouped similar cancer types together (e.g. leukemias \nand lymphomas, gynecological cancers) \n\n\u25cf Revised indeterminate imaging and contraindications to \nconventional imaging sections \n\n\u25cf Addition of the use of Amyloid PET for early Alzheimer\u2019s \n\u25cf Updated: \n\n\u25cb Surveillance PET section added to disease type where \nappropriate \n\n\u25cb Combination imaging added to disease type where \nappropriate \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 39 of 45 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 070-1 for PET Scan \n\n\u25cb Following Cancers to be consistent with updated version \nof NCCN \n\u25a0 Adrenal: added indications in limited circumstances \n\u25a0 Ampullary adenocarcinoma: added section \n\u25a0 Anal carcinoma: added indications for radiation \n\nplanning \n\u25a0 Bone tumors: added combination imaging \n\nrecommendations, removed age restrictions on PET  \n\u25a0 Cervical cancer: added neuroendocrine small cell \n\ncarcinoma of the cervix, added surveillance indication \n\u25a0 Gastrointestinal stromal tumor: added indication for 2-\n\n4 weeks after initiation of TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) \ntherapy \n\n\u25a0 Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: added indication \nfor potentially surgically curable metastatic disease \n\n\u25a0 Lymphoma: added clarification by sub-type of \nlymphoma, added indications for combination imaging \nin pediatric patients, added surveillance indications \n\n\u25a0 Melanoma: added indication for patients considering \nor receiving systemic treatment with immunotherapy \n\n\u25a0 Neuroblastoma: added surveillance indications \n\u25a0 Neuroendocrine: added detail regarding what is \n\nneeded for restaging in SSTR section \n\u25a0 Non-malignant disease: added dementia section,  \n\u25a0 Non-small cell lung cancer: added qualifiers to \n\nrestaging indications (Indicated for any of the \nfollowing: pre-surgical evaluation, suspected or \nconfirmed progression/recurrence, indeterminate \nfindings on conventional imaging, end of treatment \nevaluation) \n\n\u25a0 Penile cancer: added indication for suspected inguinal \nlymph node positive disease (based on imaging or \nexam) \n\n\u25a0 Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma: separated from \ngeneral neuroendocrine tumors, added clarification to \nindications for FDG tracer vs. SSTR tracer \n\n\u25a0 Prostate cancer: Reorganized section to include all \ntracers, updated restaging indications \n\n\u25a0 Rectal cancer: separated from colon cancer \n\u25a0 Small cell lung cancer: clarified initial staging \n\nindication to indicated if needed to clarify extent of \ndisease \n\n\u25a0 Soft tissue sarcomas: added specific indications for \nsub-categories of soft tissue sarcoma (angiosarcoma, \nclear cell sarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, malignant \nperipheral nerve sheath sarcoma (MPNST), \nmyxoid/round cell liposarcoma), added combination \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 40 of 45 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 070-1 for PET Scan \n\nimaging recommendations, removed age restrictions \non PET  \n\n\u25a0 Systemic light chain amyloidosis: added section \n\u25a0 Testicular cancer: added initial staging indication for all \n\nhistologies for prior indeterminate imaging when \nretroperitoneal dissection is under consideration and \nextent of disease needs clarification  \n\n\u25a0 Vulvar cancer: added indications for when sentinel \nlymph node biopsy is positive and when metastases \nare suspected  \n\nMay 2023 \u25cf Reorganized: \n\u25cb Cancers where the guidance is straightforward into a list \n\nfor ICRs and non-PET PCRs can approve/deny \n\u25cb Definitions to background \n\n\u25cf Revised indeterminate imaging and contraindications to \nconventional imaging sections \n\n\u25cf Updated: \n\u25cb Surveillance PET section with additional guidance \n\u25cb Following Cancers to be consistent with updated version \n\nof NCCN \n\u25a0 Adrenal: added indications in limited circumstances \n\u25a0 Breast: changed to requiring inconclusive imaging and \n\nadded a restaging indication for FES PET in special \ntracer section \n\n\u25a0 Colorectal: added liver directed therapy and potentially \ncurable M1 disease to restaging \n\n\u25a0 Esophageal: initial staging clarified as indicated for \nnon-metastatic, restaging changed from indicated to \nfollowing chemoradiation or with indeterminate \nimaging \n\n\u25a0 Small cell lung cancer: clarified staging in background \nsection, limited stage: changed restaging to prior to \nradiation or with indeterminate imaging;

It is useful in specific scenarios after initial \nCT and/or MR imaging has been obtained for assessment of, patients with acute stroke, and \nalso a wide range of patients with other cerebrovascular diseases. In evaluating acute stroke \nit may assist in differentiating the unsalvageable core infarct and salvageable ischemic \nregions of the brain that may benefit from thrombectomy or thrombolysis. (2) \n\nContraindications and Preferred Studies \n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why a CT/CTA cannot be performed may include: \n\nimpaired renal function, significant allergy to IV contrast, pregnancy (depending on \ntrimester). \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 7 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 015 for Cerebral Perfusion CT \n\n\u25cf Contraindications and reasons why an MRI/MRA cannot be performed may include: \nimpaired renal function, claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible devices (such as non-\ncompatible defibrillator or pacemaker), metallic fragments in a high-risk location, \npatient exceeds weight limit/dimensions of MRI machine. \n\nAcute Cerebral Ischemia \nCerebral perfusion CT can quantitatively distinguish the extent of irreversibly infarcted brain \ntissue (infarct core) from the severely ischemic but salvageable tissue (penumbra), providing \na basis for the selection of acute stroke patients that are most likely to benefit from \nthrombolytic treatment(2) \n\nCerebral Ischemia and Infarction and Evaluation of \nVasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) \nCerebral perfusion CT can be useful in identifying patients at risk for cerebral ischemia or \ninfarction and for evaluation of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Catheter \nangiography is the gold standard for detecting vasospasm. Screening for vasospasm can be \nperformed with TCD US (transcranial doppler ultrasound) and has high sensitivity and \nnegative predictive value. CTA, CT perfusion or MRA may be useful in the setting of \nindeterminate TCD. CT or MR perfusion can help differentiate patients with vascular \nnarrowing but normal perfusion due to the presence of collateral circulation from those \nwithout adequate collaterals. \n\nCarotid Artery Stent Placement/Revascularization \nCerebral perfusion CT helps in the assessment of the hemodynamic modifications in \npatients with severe carotid stenosis. Pre-operatively, CTP may help identify patients at high \nrisk of developing hyperperfusion syndrome after carotid revascularization. The presence of \ninternal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis \u226590% is a main risk factor for the development of HPS. \nOther important risk factors include severe contralateral ICA disease, poor collateral flow, \nhypertension, and recent stroke or ischemia Post-operatively CTP provides valuable \ninformation for a more thorough assessment in the follow-up of patients after they have \nundergone carotid revascularization, especially when there is concern for hyperperfusion \nsyndrome.(1,2) \n\nTemporary Balloon Occlusion (TBO) \nBallon occlusion testing is used prior to a planned endovascular or surgical procedure that \nwill disrupt blood flow to a part of the brain. CTP can be used to detect patients who may not \ntolerate a prolonged occlusion during a surgery/procedure. Given the length of testing and \nthe need for transport other methods are generally preferred. (11,12) \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 5 of 7 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 015 for Cerebral Perfusion CT \n\nCerebrovascular Reserve \nCerebral perfusion CT, in conjunction with acetazolamide challenge in patients with \nintracranial vascular stenosis, can evaluate cerebrovascular reserve capacity and help in \nestimating the potential risk of stroke. It may help to identify candidates for bypass surgery \nand endovascular treatment to increase cerebral blood flow.(13,14) \n\nIntracranial Tumors \nCerebral perfusion CT generates permeability measurements in images of brain tumors \ndepicting areas of different blood flow within tumors and the surrounding tissues. This may \nallow for diagnosis and grading of tumors and may help to monitor treatment.

In October \n2017, the FDA cleared the first 7 T MRI units.(1)The definition of mid and low field MRI is \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 3 of 4 \n\nEvolent Clinical Guideline 064 for Low Field MRI \n\nmore variable with mid field units having a lower field strength range of 0.3 to 0.5 and an \nupper limit under 1.0 T. Low field units have field strengths below 0.3 to 0.2 T. The major \ndisadvantage of low field strength MRI relative to higher field scanners is lower signal to \nnoise ratios, less homogeneity in the magnetic field, lower detection of calcification, \nhemorrhage, or gadolinium enhancement. Lee et al showed that low field (<0.5 T) units were \neffective in evaluating medial meniscal, anterior cruciate ligament, and rotator cuff tears but \nnot effective for evaluating lateral meniscal tears, osteochondral defects, or shoulder \nsuperior labrum-anterior posterior (SLAP) ligament complex pathology.(2,3) \n\nPOLICY HISTORY \nSummary \nDate Summary \nMarch 2024 \u25cf No significant changes \nMarch 2023 \u25cf General Information moved to beginning of guideline with \n\nadded statement on clinical indications not addressed in this \nguideline \n\n\u25cf Removed additional sources \n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE \nGuideline Approval \nCommittee \nReviewed / Approved by Evolent Specialty Clinical Guideline Review Committee \n\nDisclaimer \nEvolent Clinical Guidelines do not constitute medical advice.
